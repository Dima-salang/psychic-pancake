This passage is a **high-level, informal lecture-style explanation of hyperparameters in deep learning**. It’s conceptually rich but needs to be **condensed, clarified, and made more structured** to aid comprehension. Below is a rewritten version that keeps all the key ideas intact while improving clarity, organization, and educational value.

### 📘 Understanding Hyperparameters in Deep Learning

To effectively develop deep neural networks, you must **organize not only your model’s parameters but also its *hyperparameters*.** Let's break that down:

---

### 🔧 Model Parameters vs. Hyperparameters

| Type                | Examples                                                                                                       | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parameters**      | `W` (weights), `b` (biases)                                                                                    | Learned by the model during training to minimize the cost function. |
| **Hyperparameters** | `α` (learning rate), number of hidden layers, number of units per layer, activation function, batch size, etc. | Set manually before training; they influence how the model learns.  |

These **hyperparameters** determine how your model’s actual parameters (`W`, `b`) evolve during training. That’s why they’re called *“hyper”* — they’re “above” the parameters.

### ⚙️ Common Hyperparameters

Here are some core hyperparameters you'll encounter:

* **Learning Rate (α)** – Controls how big each update step is in gradient descent.
* **Number of Iterations** – How many steps of gradient descent to take.
* **Number of Hidden Layers (L)** – Depth of your network.
* **Hidden Units per Layer** – Width of each hidden layer.
* **Activation Functions** – ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, etc.
* **Batch Size** – Number of training examples used in one iteration.
* **Momentum / Regularization Terms** – Advanced techniques to stabilize training.

### 🔁 Why Hyperparameter Tuning Matters

Training a deep net is largely **empirical**. That means:

* You often **don’t know the best values ahead of time**.
* You need to **experiment**, observe performance, and iterate.

#### Example: Learning Rate Tuning

Try different values for the learning rate α:

* **Too low** → very slow convergence.
* **Too high** → the cost function might **diverge** or oscillate.
* **Just right** → fast and stable learning.

You might visualize the cost function `J` over epochs:

* Good α → smooth descent
* Bad α → divergence or stagnation

> *“Deep learning is an empirical science. You try things and see what works.”*

### 🧪 Trial and Error is Normal

When starting a new project:

* Try different numbers of layers, hidden units, learning rates.
* Evaluate each configuration on a **validation set**.
* Iterate based on what improves performance.

Even if you're an expert, it’s **rare to get hyperparameters right the first time**. And what works in one domain (e.g. vision) might not work in another (e.g. NLP).

---

### 🔄 Hyperparameters May Change Over Time

Even within the same domain, best hyperparameter settings can evolve due to:

* Changes in dataset size or nature
* Hardware improvements (e.g., better GPUs)
* Algorithmic updates

**Tip:** Periodically re-tune your hyperparameters to adapt to these changes.

---

### 🧠 Final Thoughts

* Hyperparameters are essential to getting deep learning to work well.
* It’s okay to experiment — everyone does it.
* Over time, you'll **build intuition** for which hyperparameters to try first.
* Later courses and tools (like random search, grid search, Bayesian optimization) help **systematize** this process.
