# 🧠 Lecture: The Basic Recipe for Improving Neural Networks

### A practical system for debugging and improving your models

---

## 🛠️ Problem: Your model’s not good enough. What do you fix?

In the last video, you learned to diagnose whether the problem is:

* **High Bias** (underfitting)
* **High Variance** (overfitting)
* **Both**
* **Neither (success!)**

Now we ask: **What actions should you take?**

## 📋 The Basic Recipe: A Decision Tree for Model Improvement

```text
Train model → Diagnose → Choose remedy → Repeat
```

### ✅ Step 1: Diagnose Bias

**Look at training set error:**

| Symptom          | Diagnosis     |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| High train error | High bias     |
| Low train error  | No bias issue |

---

### 🩺 Remedies for High Bias (Underfitting)

| Strategy                          | Why It Helps                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ **Use a bigger model**          | More layers or units = more capacity |
| ✅ **Train longer**                | Allows the model to minimize loss    |
| ✅ **Try a better optimizer**      | E.g., Adam, RMSProp over SGD         |
| ✅ **Try different architectures** | Some models are better suited        |

> **Goal**: Drive down training error to near 0% (or Bayes error)

> ✔ “Fitting the training data is your first victory.”

---

### ✅ Step 2: Diagnose Variance

**Look at dev set error:**

| Symptom                 | Diagnosis         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Train error ≪ Dev error | High variance     |
| Train ≈ Dev error       | No variance issue |

---

### 🩺 Remedies for High Variance (Overfitting)

| Strategy                       | Why It Helps                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Get more data**            | Smooths the model’s learning      |
| ✅ **Apply regularization**     | Penalizes overly complex weights  |
| ✅ **Try dropout**              | Prevents co-adaptation of neurons |
| ✅ **Try simpler architecture** | Less overcapacity                 |

> **Goal**: Improve generalization — get dev error closer to train error.

---

## 🔁 Repeat

Once you reduce bias:

* Re-diagnose variance

Once you reduce variance:

* Re-check bias (rarely comes back if network is big enough)

## 🧠 Efficiency Tip: Pick the Right Fix

**Don't waste time on things that won’t help.**

| If you have…  | Don't do this                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High bias     | ❌ Don’t collect more data (won’t help)     |
| High variance | ❌ Don’t make network bigger (likely worse) |

> **Be systematic**: Diagnosis → Fix → Re-diagnose

---

## 🔄 Bias–Variance Tradeoff: The Modern Take

> In classical ML: fixing bias often worsens variance
> In deep learning: this **tradeoff is weaker**

### Why?

* **Big networks**: Easy to reduce bias with more layers/units
* **Regularization**: Keeps variance low
* **Data abundance**: More data improves generalization

So in deep learning:

> **“We can reduce bias or variance without hurting the other — as long as we regularize and manage compute cost.”**

## 📊 Table: Remedies Summary

| Problem       | Symptom                 | Solutions                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| High Bias     | High train error        | Bigger model, longer training, better optimizer |
| High Variance | Dev error ≫ Train error | More data, regularization, dropout              |
| Both          | High train + dev error  | Bigger model + regularization + more data       |

## ⚠️ Bonus: Regularization Does Slightly Raise Bias

* Regularization (like L2) can **slightly hurt bias**
* But in practice, with large networks, this impact is small

→ So you can almost always **regularize to reduce variance** with minimal harm

---

## 🧠 Summary: The Basic Recipe

```text
1. Train model
2. Check train/dev error
3. Diagnose: Bias? Variance?
4. Choose targeted fix:
   - Bias → Bigger model, train longer, new arch
   - Variance → More data, regularization, simpler model
5. Repeat
```

> This cycle — diagnose, fix, repeat — is the **core loop of applied ML**.

## 🧩 Coming Next: Regularization

In the next video, you’ll learn **exactly what regularization is**, how it works in deep learning, and how to apply it effectively (e.g. L2, dropout, etc.).

Would you like me to continue and explain **regularization** in-depth right now?
