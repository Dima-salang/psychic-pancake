Awesome ‚Äî now that we've peeled back the layers (pun intended!) and understand **how data flows forward through a neural network**, it‚Äôs time to explore the **engine of learning** in neural nets:

---

# üß† Part 2: Deep Dive into Backpropagation and Learning in Neural Networks

---

## üîÅ Recap: What Happens in a Neural Network?

In a **feedforward pass**, each layer does:

$$
\text{output} = \phi(Wx + b)
$$

* $x$: input vector
* $W$: weights matrix
* $b$: biases
* $\phi$: non-linear activation (like ReLU, Sigmoid)

The **output of one layer becomes the input to the next**, all the way to the final prediction.

But this just *produces outputs*.

How do we actually **learn** the right values for $W$ and $b$?
‚û°Ô∏è **Backpropagation + Gradient Descent**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step: What Is Backpropagation?

Backpropagation is the algorithm that:

* Computes the **gradient** (partial derivative) of the loss with respect to **each parameter** in the network
* **Pushes the error backward** from the output layer to each previous layer
* Enables the network to **learn by updating its parameters**

Let‚Äôs go layer by layer.

---

## üßÆ Step 1: Define a Loss Function

Suppose:

* Your network outputs $\hat{y}$
* True label is $y$

Then your **loss function** could be something like:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\hat{y} - y)^2
$$

or for classification:

$$
\mathcal{L} = -y \log(\hat{y}) - (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \quad \text{(Binary cross-entropy)}
$$

---

## üß∞ Step 2: Chain Rule (Backpropagation's Heart)

You use the **chain rule of calculus** to compute:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W}
$$

The idea:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a} \cdot \frac{\partial a}{\partial z} \cdot \frac{\partial z}{\partial W}
$$

Where:

* $z = Wx + b$
* $a = \phi(z)$

This computes how changing $W$ affects the loss.

---

## üîÑ Step 3: Backward Through Layers

Backpropagation works **layer by layer, backward** from the output.

At each layer:

1. Compute how the loss changes w\.r.t. the layer's output.
2. Compute the gradient of the activation.
3. Compute the gradient of the weights and biases.
4. Pass the error backward to the previous layer.

Each neuron contributes to the total error ‚Äî and each layer ‚Äúblames‚Äù its inputs for the part of the error it's responsible for.

---

## üí• Example: Manual Backpropagation (PyTorch + Autograd Later)

### Let‚Äôs say you have:

* One input: $x = [1.0, 2.0]$
* One hidden layer (2 neurons, ReLU)
* One output (regression)
* No batch for simplicity

### Forward Pass:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Inputs and targets
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0])
y = torch.tensor([1.0])  # ground truth

# Weights and biases
W1 = torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]], requires_grad=True)  # 2x2
b1 = torch.tensor([0.0, 0.0], requires_grad=True)

W2 = torch.tensor([[0.5], [0.6]], requires_grad=True)  # 2x1
b2 = torch.tensor([0.0], requires_grad=True)

# Layer 1
z1 = x @ W1 + b1
a1 = F.relu(z1)

# Layer 2
z2 = a1 @ W2 + b2
y_hat = z2

# Loss
loss = 0.5 * (y_hat - y)**2
```

### Backward Pass:

```python
loss.backward()

# Now PyTorch has computed:
# W1.grad, b1.grad, W2.grad, b2.grad
```

PyTorch handles the chain rule *automatically*, building a **computational graph** under the hood.

---

## üìâ Step 4: Update Parameters (Gradient Descent)

Now we apply:

$$
\theta \leftarrow \theta - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta}
$$

In code:

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    W1 -= learning_rate * W1.grad
    b1 -= learning_rate * b1.grad
    W2 -= learning_rate * W2.grad
    b2 -= learning_rate * b2.grad

    # Don't forget to zero the gradients!
    W1.grad.zero_()
    b1.grad.zero_()
    W2.grad.zero_()
    b2.grad.zero_()
```

## ‚ö° Key Concepts Often Missed

| üîç Detail                                       | Why It Matters                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gradients are local**                         | Each layer only looks at its output and passes blame backward    |
| **ReLU derivative**                             | 0 if input < 0, 1 if input > 0 ‚Äî kills gradient if neuron "dead" |
| **Bias has gradients too**                      | Bias gradients are just added from neuron errors                 |
| **Zeroing gradients**                           | PyTorch accumulates gradients by default ‚Äî you must reset them!  |
| **Activation function choice affects backprop** | Sigmoid causes vanishing gradients; ReLU is better but can "die" |
| **Learning rate $\eta$**                        | Too high? Explodes. Too low? Slow learning or stuck in minima    |

---

## üìä Optional: Visual Summary

* Forward: $x \rightarrow a_1 \rightarrow a_2 \rightarrow \hat{y}$
* Loss: Compare $\hat{y}$ with $y$
* Backward: $\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{d\hat{y}} \rightarrow \frac{d\mathcal{L}}{da_2} \rightarrow \frac{d\mathcal{L}}{da_1}$
* Update: Adjust $W, b$ using gradients

---

## üß† Long-Term Understanding: Try This

* **Visualize** gradients during training
* **Watch** the weights change
* **Use** small examples and debug the `.grad` values
* **Train** a net on XOR or MNIST from scratch

---

Would you like the next lecture to be about:

* Different **activation functions** and their math?
* **Batching**, **momentum**, and **optimizers**?
* Or maybe we implement a simple **neural net from scratch** (no PyTorch) to demystify everything?


Absolutely! Let's now **simplify and deeply understand** the **mathematics of backpropagation and neural layers** ‚Äî with **clear intuition**, **plain language**, and **progressive visual reasoning**. The goal is for you to internalize not just *what* the formulas say, but *why* they make sense.

---

## üéØ Big Goal: What Do Neural Nets Actually Do?

They do **two things**:

1. **Make a prediction** (forward pass)
2. **Learn from mistakes** (backward pass)

Mathematically, this means:

* Take input $x$, do computations layer by layer ‚Üí prediction $\hat{y}$
* Compare $\hat{y}$ to actual $y$
* Use calculus (chain rule) to figure out how each parameter in the network contributed to the error
* Adjust each parameter to reduce the error next time

---

## üß± Step-by-Step: Understanding One Layer

### Imagine this layer:

* You have **input**:

  $$
  x = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  x_2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

* You have **weights**:

  $$
  W = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  w_{11} & w_{12} \\
  w_{21} & w_{22} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

* You have **biases**:

  $$
  b = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  b_1 \\
  b_2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

Then the layer computes:

$$
z = Wx + b
$$

Which just means:

$$
z_1 = w_{11}x_1 + w_{12}x_2 + b_1  
$$

$$
z_2 = w_{21}x_1 + w_{22}x_2 + b_2
$$

Then, apply activation function $\phi$ (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid):

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

---

## üîÅ Forward Pass is Just This (per layer):

* Weighted sum: $z = Wx + b$
* Activation: $a = \phi(z)$

Each **layer** just transforms the input ‚Üí new input for next layer.

---

## üéØ Now, Backpropagation: Learning from Mistakes

Imagine the final prediction is wrong. Backpropagation helps us find:

> ‚ùùHow much did each weight contribute to the mistake, and how should I adjust it to make the error smaller next time?‚ùû

When you start to change the weight, you observe where the loss moves, if it moves up, you move the weight the other direction to lower the loss. This is the main principle behind gauging the rate of change and optimizing a neural network. 

This is done using **gradients** (slopes/derivatives).

---

## üöó What Is a Gradient?

A gradient is just **how fast something changes**.

Example:
If your car is going 60 km/h, then:

* Speed = **change in position per time**
* Similarly, gradient = **change in loss per weight**

So for weight $w$:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w}
$$

This says:

> "If I change $w$ a little, how much will the loss change?"

![[Pasted image 20250530221521.png]]
---

## üîó Backpropagation Uses the Chain Rule

Why? Because each layer is *composed* of smaller functions.

Let‚Äôs say:

* Output $\hat{y} = f(Wx + b)$
* Loss $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\hat{y} - y)^2$

To know how to change $W$, we do:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = 
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} \cdot 
\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z} \cdot 
\frac{\partial z}{\partial W}
$$

It‚Äôs like saying:

> "How much the loss depends on the output"
> √ó "How much the output depends on the layer"
> √ó "How much the layer depends on the weight"

This is the **chain rule** from calculus.

# Example

![[Pasted image 20250530222914.png]]




## üîç What Does Each Piece Mean?

### 1. Loss gradient:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} = \hat{y} - y
$$

Because $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{y} - y)^2$

### 2. Activation gradient:

Depends on the activation function.

* Sigmoid:

  $$
  \phi'(z) = \phi(z)(1 - \phi(z))
  $$
* ReLU:

  $$
  \phi'(z) = 
  \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if } z > 0 \\
  0 & \text{if } z \le 0
  \end{cases}
  $$

### 3. Weighted sum gradient:

$$
\frac{\partial z}{\partial W} = x
$$

This says the change in output is *directly proportional to the input*.
If you increase the input value $x$, the output $z$ goes up.

---

## üß† Backprop Through One Neuron (Visual Intuition)

Let‚Äôs say:

$$
z = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b
\quad \text{and} \quad a = \phi(z)
\quad \text{and} \quad \hat{y} = a
\quad \text{and} \quad \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{y} - y)^2
$$

Then:

1. **Compute $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}}$**
   ‚Üí How wrong are we?

2. **Multiply by $\phi'(z)$**
   ‚Üí How sensitive is output to the activation?

3. **Multiply by $x$**
   ‚Üí How much influence did the input have?

That gives:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} = (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \phi'(z) \cdot x
$$

---

## üì¶ What About Bias?

The gradient of loss with respect to the bias is:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b} = (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \phi'(z)
$$

Bias has **no input multiplier** because:

$$
\frac{d}{db}(Wx + b) = 1
$$

## üß™ Want to Practice?

Try by hand:

* 1 input neuron ‚Üí 1 output neuron (no layers)
* Use sigmoid and squared error
* Compute forward pass
* Compute loss
* Compute derivative step by step

Then, repeat with:

* One hidden layer
* ReLU
* Manual gradient updates

I can give you an exercise with full solutions if you want!

Would you like that? Or should we go into **multi-layer backprop**, **matrix calculus**, or **visual intuition for learning dynamics** next?

# Where do Initial Weights Come From?
Fantastic question ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to spot this! Let's dive deep:

---

## üß† Where Do the Weights Come From in a Neural Network?

When you look at your dataset ‚Äî yes, you only have:

* **Inputs** (features)
* **Outputs** (labels, if it‚Äôs supervised learning)

But **you don‚Äôt start with any "correct" weights** ‚Äî **the model must learn them**.

So here's how it works:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. **Weights Are Initialized Randomly**

At the beginning of training:

* Each weight is assigned a **random small value**.
* These random values are usually drawn from a **normal distribution** or **uniform distribution**, often centered around zero.

> Example: A neuron might start with weights like `[0.01, -0.005, 0.03]` ‚Äî completely random.

This randomness is **essential** because:

* If all weights were the same, every neuron would behave identically.
* You need variety to break symmetry so neurons can learn different things.

> ‚úÖ Random weights give the model a "starting point" for learning.

---

## üìö 2. **Then the Model Learns the Right Weights**

Through **training**, the network adjusts its weights step by step to fit the data.

### In Supervised Learning (e.g., classification):

You give the network:

* **Inputs** (e.g., pixels of an image)
* **Target outputs** (e.g., "cat")

Then:

### Training Loop (simplified):

1. **Forward pass**:

   * Inputs are passed through the network using current weights
   * The network makes a prediction

2. **Loss is computed**:

   * Compare prediction vs. true label
   * Compute an error (e.g., using cross-entropy or MSE)

3. **Backward pass** (Backpropagation):

   * The error is propagated backward
   * Compute **gradients**: how much each weight contributed to the error

4. **Update weights**:

   * Using an optimizer (e.g., **SGD**, **Adam**), the model updates weights:

     ```text
     weight ‚Üê weight - learning_rate √ó gradient
     ```

This process is repeated **over thousands of examples**, and the weights slowly converge toward values that give **good predictions**.

---

## üéØ Summary:

| Step             | What Happens                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1. Initialize    | Random small values for each weight      |
| 2. Forward pass  | Compute prediction using current weights |
| 3. Compare       | Calculate error with actual output       |
| 4. Backward pass | Calculate gradients via backpropagation  |
| 5. Update        | Adjust weights to reduce error           |
| Repeat           | Until weights are good enough            |

---

## üí° Analogy:

Imagine your model is blindfolded, trying to unlock a safe:

* It starts turning the dials (weights) at random
* It listens for clicks (feedback from the loss function)
* It adjusts the dials slightly based on what it hears
* Eventually, with enough feedback, it unlocks the safe ‚Äî it finds the right weights

---

## üß™ Quick Code Demo (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(3, 1)  # 3 inputs ‚Üí 1 output

print("Initial weights:", model.weight)
print("Initial bias:", model.bias)
```

üì¶ Output:

```
Initial weights: Parameter containing: tensor([[ 0.0213, -0.0145, 0.0071]], requires_grad=True)
Initial bias: Parameter containing: tensor([0.0053], requires_grad=True)
```

These values were randomly initialized ‚Äî the model will update them during training!

---

Would you like to see:

* How weights are updated live during training?
* A visual of loss going down as weights improve?
* Or how different initialization methods affect learning?

Let me know how deep you want to go ‚Äî this is core to understanding how neural networks really learn.

# Biases Initialization
‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî **biases work exactly the same way as weights in terms of initialization and learning.**

Let me give you the full picture:

---

## üîç What Is a Bias in a Neural Network?

A **bias** is a scalar value added to the **weighted sum** of inputs **before** applying the activation function.

For a neuron:

```text
output = activation(w‚ÇÅ¬∑x‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇ¬∑x‚ÇÇ + ... + w‚Çô¬∑x‚Çô + b)
```

The **bias `b`** allows the activation function to be **shifted left or right**, which gives the network more flexibility to model complex relationships.

### Why is this useful?

Without a bias, the neuron is **forced to go through the origin (0,0)**. With a bias, it can shift the decision boundary.

---

## üß™ Simple Example

Say you're modeling:

```text
y = mx + c
```

In neural networks:

* `m` = weight
* `c` = bias

If you remove the bias:

```text
y = mx ‚Üí must go through (0,0)
```

Not all functions go through (0,0)! Bias gives us that extra shift to model more real-world relationships.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Bias Initialization

Just like weights:

* **Biases are initialized randomly**
* Typically set to **small values like 0.01** or even just **0**
* They are stored as **trainable parameters** (with `requires_grad=True` in PyTorch)

> Biases are learned during training, just like weights.

---

## üîÑ Training Biases

During training:

1. Bias is included in the computation of the neuron's output.
2. The **gradient of the loss with respect to the bias** is computed.
3. The bias is updated via the optimizer:

   ```text
   bias ‚Üê bias - learning_rate √ó ‚àÇLoss/‚àÇbias
   ```

---

| Concept                  | Weights                        | Biases                         |

| Shared across neurons?   | ‚ùå No ‚Äî each neuron has its own | ‚ùå No ‚Äî each neuron has its own |

## üìä Code Proof (PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(3, 1)  # 3 inputs ‚Üí 1 output

print("Weights:", model.weight)  # shape: [1, 3]
print("Bias:", model.bias)       # shape: [1]
```

üì¶ Output:

```
Weights: Parameter containing: tensor([[ 0.0075, -0.0132, 0.0063]], requires_grad=True)
Bias: Parameter containing: tensor([0.0027], requires_grad=True)
```

‚úÖ Both are randomly initialized, both are trainable, and both are updated during backpropagation.

Let me know if you want:

* A visualization of what bias does geometrically
* Code that shows how bias affects predictions
* Or how bias gradients are computed manually

# Multi-layer Backprop
Excellent ‚Äî let's now **dive deep into multi-layer backpropagation**, where the magic of deep learning truly begins.

We‚Äôll build your understanding **from neurons to layers to the full network**, following these principles:

* üîç Clear math and intuition
* üß† Conceptual understanding before equations
* üßÆ Gradual abstraction from scalar ‚Üí vector ‚Üí matrix form
* üß™ PyTorch-flavored mental model

---

# üß† Conceptual Recap Before Multi-layer Backprop

### A single layer computes:

$$
z = Wx + b \\
a = \phi(z)
$$

Where:

* $x$ = input vector (size: $n$)
* $W$ = weight matrix (shape: $\text{out} \times \text{in}$)
* $b$ = bias vector (size: $\text{out}$)
* $a$ = activated output (used as input to next layer)

Then final output:

$$
\hat{y} = a^{[L]}
$$

And loss:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y)
$$

---

# üåâ Let's Add a Hidden Layer (2-layer net)

Say:

* Input: $x$
* First layer:

  $$
  z^{[1]} = W^{[1]}x + b^{[1]}, \quad a^{[1]} = \phi(z^{[1]})
  $$
* Output layer:

  $$
  z^{[2]} = W^{[2]}a^{[1]} + b^{[2]}, \quad \hat{y} = a^{[2]} = \phi(z^{[2]})
  $$

Now, we want to **backpropagate the loss** $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y)$ to update all weights.

---

## üéØ Goal of Backprop: Find

For **each layer $l$**:

* $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[l]}}$
* $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{[l]}}$

---

# üîó Step-by-Step Backpropagation (Layer-by-Layer)

We‚Äôll go **from the last layer to the first**, using the **chain rule**.

---

## üîÅ Step 1: Output Layer Error (Layer L)

Let‚Äôs define:

$$
\delta^{[2]} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{[2]}} = (\hat{y} - y) \circ \phi'(z^{[2]})
$$

* $\circ$: elementwise (Hadamard) product
* This delta tells us: *"How much error comes from this neuron?"*

Then:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[2]}} = \delta^{[2]} \cdot (a^{[1]})^T \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{[2]}} = \delta^{[2]}
$$

Why? The gradient w\.r.t. weights is just:

> ‚ÄúError signal‚Äù √ó ‚Äúinput to this layer‚Äù

---

## üîÅ Step 2: Hidden Layer Error (Layer L‚Äì1)

Backpropagate error to previous layer:

$$
\delta^{[1]} = \left( (W^{[2]})^T \delta^{[2]} \right) \circ \phi'(z^{[1]})
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}} = \delta^{[1]} \cdot x^T \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{[1]}} = \delta^{[1]}
$$

---

## ‚õìÔ∏è Chain Rule in Matrix Form

If you had more layers, repeat:

$$
\delta^{[l]} = \left( (W^{[l+1]})^T \delta^{[l+1]} \right) \circ \phi'(z^{[l]})
$$

This is called **error backpropagation**.

---

## üì¶ Summary of Full Backprop (Vectorized)

For layer $l$:

$$
\delta^{[l]} = 
\begin{cases}
(\hat{y} - y) \circ \phi'(z^{[L]}) & \text{(if output layer)} \\
(W^{[l+1]})^T \delta^{[l+1]} \circ \phi'(z^{[l]}) & \text{(otherwise)}
\end{cases}
$$

Then:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[l]}} = \delta^{[l]} \cdot (a^{[l-1]})^T \\

# üß™ PyTorch Implementation Mental Model

In PyTorch, you don‚Äôt write all this manually ‚Äî you use `.backward()`. But **under the hood**, it follows the same logic.

Here's a conceptual snippet:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 4),  # Layer 1
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(4, 1),  # Layer 2
    nn.Sigmoid()
)

criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary Cross-Entropy Loss

x = torch.tensor([[0.5, 1.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[1.0]])

# Forward
y_hat = model(x)
loss = criterion(y_hat, y)

# Backward
loss.backward()

# Now each parameter (weights and biases) has its gradient:
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    print(name, param.grad)
```

PyTorch builds a **computational graph** during the forward pass and automatically applies **reverse-mode autodiff** using the chain rule ‚Äî exactly what we did.

---

# üîç Intuition: What Does the Gradient Really Tell Us?

For a weight $w$:

* If $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} > 0$: Increasing $w$ increases loss ‚Üí reduce it
* If $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w} < 0$: Increasing $w$ decreases loss ‚Üí increase it

Thus we update:

$$
w \leftarrow w - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w}
$$

where $\eta$ is the **learning rate**.

# üß† Mental Models You Should Keep

* **Forward pass = stacking layers**
* **Backward pass = unstacking error signals**
* **Each weight adjusts based on how responsible it was for the mistake**
* **Gradients ‚Äúflow backwards‚Äù through the network**
* **Vectorized backprop makes learning efficient and scalable**

# Backprop Math
Absolutely ‚Äî this is one of the most fundamental and magical parts of how neural networks **learn**: through **backpropagation**. We'll now go through the **mathematics of backpropagation**, **intuitively and rigorously**, to help you internalize exactly *how* and *why* neural networks learn by updating their parameters based on error.

---

# üß† What Is Backpropagation?

Backpropagation is **how neural networks learn**. It‚Äôs a method to compute the **gradient of the loss function** with respect to each **weight** and **bias** in the network, using the **chain rule of calculus**.

You use this gradient to **update parameters** using gradient descent.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview: Forward and Backward Pass

### Forward Pass:

$$
x \xrightarrow[]{\text{Layer 1}} a^{[1]} \xrightarrow[]{\text{Layer 2}} a^{[2]} \xrightarrow[]{\dots} \hat{y}
$$

### Backward Pass:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} \rightarrow \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[2]}} \rightarrow \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}}
$$

We apply the **chain rule** from the output layer backward through each layer to compute gradients.

---

# üî¢ Let's Build the Math Step by Step

Let‚Äôs assume a simple **2-layer neural network**:

### Notation:

* Input: $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$
* Hidden layer: $h = \sigma(z^{[1]})$, where $z^{[1]} = W^{[1]} x + b^{[1]}$
* Output: $\hat{y} = \sigma(z^{[2]})$, where $z^{[2]} = W^{[2]} h + b^{[2]}$
* Loss: $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y)$ (let‚Äôs say mean squared error: $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}(\hat{y} - y)^2$)

---

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Gradient Computation

We'll compute gradients **layer by layer**, from output to input.

---

## üéØ Step 1: Output Layer Gradients

Let‚Äôs compute the gradient of the loss w\.r.t. output layer weights $W^{[2]}$.

### Loss:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\hat{y} - y)^2
$$

We know:

$$
\hat{y} = \sigma(z^{[2]}) = \sigma(W^{[2]} h + b^{[2]})
$$

Using chain rule:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[2]}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} \cdot \frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z^{[2]}} \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[2]}}{\partial W^{[2]}}
$$

Breaking it down:

* $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \hat{y}} = (\hat{y} - y)$
* $\frac{\partial \hat{y}}{\partial z^{[2]}} = \sigma'(z^{[2]})$
* $\frac{\partial z^{[2]}}{\partial W^{[2]}} = h$

So:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[2]}} = (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \sigma'(z^{[2]}) \cdot h^T
$$

This gives us how much the **output weights** contribute to the error ‚Äî and in which direction they should be changed.

---

## üîÅ Step 2: Backpropagate to Hidden Layer

Now we want $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}}$

Again apply the chain rule:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{[2]}} \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[2]}}{\partial h} \cdot \frac{\partial h}{\partial z^{[1]}} \cdot \frac{\partial z^{[1]}}{\partial W^{[1]}}
$$

Where:

* $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z^{[2]}} = (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \sigma'(z^{[2]})$
* $\frac{\partial z^{[2]}}{\partial h} = W^{[2]}$
* $\frac{\partial h}{\partial z^{[1]}} = \sigma'(z^{[1]})$
* $\frac{\partial z^{[1]}}{\partial W^{[1]}} = x$

So putting it all together:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}} = \left[ (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \sigma'(z^{[2]}) \cdot W^{[2]} \right] \cdot \sigma'(z^{[1]}) \cdot x^T
$$

This gives us the gradients for **hidden layer weights** ‚Äî and again, tells us how much error flowed back and how to fix those weights.

# ‚ùì Why Do We Backpropagate This Way?

* The **loss is a scalar**, but we need to know how **every single weight** contributed to it.
* We apply the **chain rule** backward, layer by layer, to trace how each weight affected the output.
* This allows efficient calculation of **all gradients** with respect to all parameters.

---

# üß† Backprop in Vectorized Form

Instead of doing these gradients one by one (slow), we vectorize everything using matrices:

$$
\delta^{[2]} = (\hat{y} - y) \cdot \sigma'(z^{[2]})
$$

$$
\delta^{[1]} = (W^{[2]})^T \delta^{[2]} \cdot \sigma'(z^{[1]})
$$

Then we compute gradients:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[2]}} = \delta^{[2]} \cdot (a^{[1]})^T
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[1]}} = \delta^{[1]} \cdot (x)^T
$$

Where $\delta$ is the error signal for each layer.

---

# ‚úÖ Final Step: Update

Now that you have the gradients, apply gradient descent:

$$
W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[l]}}
$$

---

# üß© Want to See This in Code?

Would you like to walk through this exact math with a **fully manual PyTorch training loop** on a tiny dataset ‚Äî where we compute forward, backward, and update step-by-step?

Or would you like to explore **how these gradients flow in deeper networks**, **with ReLU or other activations**, and even how **non-convexity** and **vanishing gradients** happen?

Let me know what you'd like to dive into next ‚Äî we‚Äôre deep in the neural trenches now!

# Updating Parameters

Excellent question ‚Äî this is the heart of *training* a neural network. You‚Äôve now seen how **errors (gradients)** are computed using **backpropagation**, but let‚Äôs now walk through the next crucial step:

> üîß **How do we actually update the parameters (weights and biases) to learn from those errors?**

---

# üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Parameter Update After Backpropagation

After the forward and backward passes are complete, the neural network has:

* For each layer $l$:

  * Gradient of loss w\.r.t. weights: $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[l]}}$
  * Gradient of loss w\.r.t. biases: $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{[l]}}$

To make the model **better** (i.e., reduce the loss), we adjust weights and biases **in the opposite direction of the gradient** (gradient descent):

$$
W^{[l]} := W^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W^{[l]}}
$$

$$
b^{[l]} := b^{[l]} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b^{[l]}}
$$

Where:

* $\eta$ (eta) is the **learning rate** ‚Äî a small positive number like 0.01 or 0.001

---

# üß† Why This Works (Intuition)

* The gradient tells you **"if I increase this weight slightly, the loss will increase by this much"**
* So we *decrease* the weight in proportion to that gradient to **minimize loss**
* This is the core of the **gradient descent** optimization algorithm

---

# üîÅ Training Loop (Conceptual)

This happens **on every training iteration**:

1. **Forward pass**: Compute $\hat{y} = f(x)$
2. **Loss**: Compute $\mathcal{L}(\hat{y}, y)$
3. **Backward pass**: Compute gradients $\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W}, \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial b}$
4. **Update parameters**: Use gradients to nudge weights and biases

---

# üî¨ PyTorch Version: Manual Gradient Descent

Here's how it works in PyTorch *without* using built-in optimizers (for educational clarity):

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 4),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(4, 1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)

criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary cross-entropy
learning_rate = 0.1

x = torch.tensor([[0.5, 1.0]], requires_grad=True)
y = torch.tensor([[1.0]])

# Step 1: Forward pass
y_hat = model(x)
loss = criterion(y_hat, y)

# Step 2: Backward pass
loss.backward()

# Step 3: Update parameters manually
with torch.no_grad():  # Temporarily disable gradient tracking
    for param in model.parameters():
        param -= learning_rate * param.grad  # Gradient descent step
        param.grad.zero_()  # Clear gradient for next iteration
```

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è Optimizers: The PyTorch Way (Recommended for Real Projects)

Instead of manual updates, you can use built-in optimizers:

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Training step:
optimizer.zero_grad()       # Clear previous gradients
y_hat = model(x)            # Forward
loss = criterion(y_hat, y)  # Loss
loss.backward()             # Backward
optimizer.step()            # Update parameters
```

This way, you can easily switch to more advanced optimizers like Adam or RMSProp.

---

# üí° Learning Rate (Œ∑) Tips

* **Too small**: slow learning, may take ages to converge
* **Too large**: may overshoot minima or diverge
* Best practice: use **learning rate schedulers** or optimizers like **Adam** that adaptively tune step sizes
