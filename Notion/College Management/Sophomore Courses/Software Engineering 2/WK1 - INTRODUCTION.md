**Introduction to Software Engineering**

Software engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with all aspects of software production. It involves applying appropriate theories and methods to solve problems, while also considering organizational and financial constraints. This includes not just the technical development process, but also project management and the creation of tools and methods to support production.

Software is defined as computer programs and their associated documentation. Software products can be developed either for a specific customer (customized products) or for a general market (generic products).

**The Importance of Software Engineering**

The economies of all developed nations are dependent on software. Increasingly, more systems are software controlled. Expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed countries. Software costs often dominate computer system costs, frequently being greater than the hardware cost on a PC. Importantly, software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. For systems with a long life, maintenance costs may be several times the development costs. Software engineering is therefore concerned with **cost-effective software development**.

Software project failure can occur due to increasing system complexity, where demands require systems to be built and delivered more quickly, become even larger and more complex, and incorporate previously impossible capabilities. Failure to use software engineering methods is another reason for project failure. Many companies have transitioned into software development without adopting these methods, leading to software that is often more expensive and less reliable than it should be.

**Essential Attributes of Good Software**

Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user. Beyond this, several other attributes are considered essential for good software:

- **Maintainability:** Software should be written so it can evolve to meet changing customer needs. This is critical because change is an inevitable requirement in a changing business environment.
- **Dependability and security:** This includes characteristics like reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage upon system failure, and malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system.
- **Efficiency:** Software should avoid wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. This encompasses aspects like responsiveness, processing time, and memory utilisation.
- **Acceptability:** Software must be acceptable to its intended users. This implies being understandable, usable, and compatible with other systems the users employ.

**Fundamental Software Engineering Activities**

There are four fundamental activities involved in software engineering:

- **Software specification:** Customers and engineers define the software to be produced and constraints on its operation.
- **Software development:** The software is designed and programmed.
- **Software validation:** The software is checked to ensure it meets customer requirements.
- **Software evolution:** The software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

**Distinctions and Challenges**

Software engineering differs from computer science in that computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals, while software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software. Software engineering is also part of system engineering, which is a broader field encompassing all aspects of computer-based systems development, including hardware, software, and process engineering.

Key challenges facing software engineering include coping with increasing diversity, meeting demands for reduced delivery times, and developing trustworthy software.

**Software Product Types and Specification**

Software products fall into two main categories:

- **Generic products:** Stand-alone systems marketed and sold to any customer. Examples include PC software like graphics programs, project management tools, and CAD software, as well as software for specific markets like appointments systems for dentists. For generic products, the software developer owns the specification and makes decisions on changes.
- **Customized products:** Software commissioned by a specific customer to meet their needs. Examples include embedded control systems, air traffic control software, and traffic monitoring systems. For customized products, the customer owns the specification and makes decisions on required changes.

**General Issues Affecting Software**

Several general issues influence software development:

- **Heterogeneity:** Systems increasingly need to operate as distributed systems across networks with different types of computers and mobile devices.
- **Business and social change:** Rapid changes in business and society require the ability to change existing software and rapidly develop new software.
- **Security and trust:** As software is deeply integrated into all aspects of life, it is essential that users can trust the software they use.
- **Scale:** Software must be developed across a wide range of scales, from small embedded systems in portable devices to large Internet-scale, cloud-based systems.

**Software Engineering Diversity and Fundamentals**

There is significant diversity in software systems, and no single universal set of software techniques applies to all types. The methods and tools used depend on the type of application, customer requirements, and the development team's background. Application types include stand-alone applications, interactive transaction-based applications, embedded control systems, batch processing systems, entertainment systems, systems for modeling and simulation, data collection systems, and systems of systems.

Despite this diversity, some fundamental principles apply to all types of software system, regardless of the development techniques used:

- Systems should be developed using a managed and understood development process, although different processes are suitable for different types of software.
- Dependability and performance are important for all systems.
- Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements (defining what the software should do) are crucial.
- Where appropriate, you should reuse software that has already been developed rather than writing new software.

**Internet Software Engineering**

The web has become a platform for running applications, leading organizations to increasingly develop web-based systems over local ones. This has facilitated the availability of software services accessible over the web. Cloud computing is an approach where applications run remotely on the 'cloud,' and users typically pay based on usage rather than purchasing the software. While web-based systems are complex and distributed, the fundamental principles of software engineering remain applicable to them. Software reuse is a dominant approach for constructing web-based systems, often involving assembling systems from pre-existing components and services. Incremental and agile development are recommended for web-based systems, as it is often impractical to specify all requirements in advance. Service-oriented software engineering, where components are stand-alone web services, is also used.

**Software Engineering Ethics**

Software engineering involves responsibilities beyond just technical skills. Software engineers must behave honestly and ethically to be respected as professionals. Ethical behaviour goes beyond simply following the law; it involves adhering to a set of morally correct principles.

Key issues of professional responsibility for software engineers include:

- **Confidentiality:** Respecting the confidentiality of employers or clients, even without a formal agreement.
- **Competence:** Not misrepresenting one's level of competence and not knowingly accepting work that is outside one's skillset.
- **Intellectual property rights:** Being aware of laws regarding intellectual property and ensuring that the IP of employers and clients is protected.
- **Computer misuse:** Not using technical skills to misuse other people's computers, ranging from trivial activities like playing games on an employer's machine to serious issues like disseminating viruses.

The ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics provides principles for the behaviour and decisions of professional software engineers. It highlights the significant opportunities software engineers have to do good or cause harm due to the central role of computers in society. The code aims to ensure that software engineering is a beneficial and respected profession.

The Code outlines eight key principles:

1. **PUBLIC:** Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. **CLIENT AND EMPLOYER:** Software engineers shall act in the best interests of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest.
3. **PRODUCT:** Software engineers shall ensure their products and modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. **JUDGMENT:** Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. **MANAGEMENT:** Software engineering managers shall promote an ethical approach to management.
6. **PROFESSION:** Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession.
7. **COLLEAGUES:** Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of colleagues.
8. **SELF:** Software engineers shall engage in lifelong learning and promote an ethical approach to their practice.

**Case Study Example: Insulin Pump Control System**

The source introduces a case study of an insulin pump control system as an example of a safety-critical system. This system collects data from a blood sugar sensor, calculates the necessary insulin amount based on the rate of change, and signals a micro-pump to deliver the dose. It is considered safety-critical because low blood sugar can lead to severe consequences like brain malfunctioning, coma, and death, while high blood sugar levels have long-term consequences like eye and kidney damage. Essential high-level requirements for such a system include being available to deliver insulin when needed and performing reliably to deliver the correct amount to counteract blood sugar levels. The system must be designed and implemented to consistently meet these requirements. Ethical dilemmas can arise in software engineering, such as disagreeing with management policies, an employer releasing an inadequately tested safety-critical system, or participation in developing military weapons systems.
