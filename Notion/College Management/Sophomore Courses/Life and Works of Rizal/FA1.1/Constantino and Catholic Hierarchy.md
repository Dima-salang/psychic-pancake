  

Recto’s belief was that the reading of Rizal’s novels would strengthen the Filipinism of the youth and foster patriotism.

Recto is the original author of the RA 1425 bill to make Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo as compulsory readings in all universities and colleges.

Recto went on record for the nationalization of all schools. he contended that nationalization might just be the step needed to foster a more vibrant nationalism among filipinos.

# Arguments against

- opposition from the Catholic hierarchy spearheaded in the Senate by:
    - Senators Decoroso Rosales, brother of Archbishop Cuenco;
    - Francisco Rodrigo, former president of Catholic Action.
- their argument was that the bill would **violate freedom of conscience and religion.**
- local and foreign clerics opposed the bill and sought to have closed-door conferences to exert pressure against the bill
- the catholic action of manila held two activities: a symposium and open forum in which two announcements were made:
    - the Sentinel, the official organ of Philippine Catholic Action, would be published daily instead of weekly
    - Filipino Catholics would be urged to write their congressmen and senators asking them to kill the Rizal bill.
- Fr, Jesus Cavanna introduced as an authority on Rizal, said that the novels **belong to the past** and it would be harmful to read them because they **presented a false picture of conditions in the country at that time**. **He described the Noli as an attack on the clergy and said its object was “put to ridicule the Catholic Faith.”**
    - He alleged that only 25 patriotic passages were present while 120 were anti-Catholic attacks.
- Jesus Paredes, a radio commentator, said that since the novel contained objectionable matter by the hierarchy, Catholics had the right to refuse to read them so as not to “endanger their salvation”
- the hierarchy played dirty with threatening to close catholic schools and even threatening senators who will vote for the bill to be punished in the next election.

  

On May 12, a unanimous approval of a substitute measure authored by Laurel was passed. it was clearly an accommodation to the objections of the hierarchy. though it still provided that the basic texts in the collegiate courses should unexpurgated editions of the two novels, it was not possible for students to be exempted from using the unexpurgated editions on grounds of religious belief.

opponents of the original Recto version claimed a “complete victory”
