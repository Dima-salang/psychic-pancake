  

According to Senator Laurel, the object of the measure was to disseminate the ideas and ideals of the Jose Rizal:

- â€œNoli and el Fili must be read by all Filipinos. They must be taken to heart, for in their pages we see ourselves as in a mirror; our defects as well as our strength, our virtues as well as our vices. only then would we become conscious as a people, and so learn to prepare ourselves for painful sacrifices that ultimately lead to self-reliance, self-respect, and freedom.

  

the Catholic hierarchy assailed that the measure was an attempt to discredit their religion. they claim that the two novels contained views inimical or opposite to the tents of their faith, they particularly challenged the compulsory nature of the bill as violative of religious freedom.

Principal basis of their opposition was an alleged Pastoral Letter, which while praising Rizal, practically branded his novels as heretical and impious. the authenticity of the letter was never definitely established.
