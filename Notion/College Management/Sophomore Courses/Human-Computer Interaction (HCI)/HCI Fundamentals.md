> [!important] HCI is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the design of computer systems, programs, or applications and, in particular, the interaction between the users, who are human beings, and computers.

**We are surrounded by not so usable and ineffective systems!**

  

# Goals of HCI

A central concern of interaction design is to develop interactive products that are usable. A key question for interaction design is, _**“How do you optimize the users’ interactions with a system, environment, or product so that they support the users’ activities in effective, useful, usable, and pleasurable ways?”**_

To allow people to execute or do tasks

- Safely
- Effectively
- Efficiently
- Enjoyable

# Usability Explained

Usability refers to ensuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user’s perspective. It involves optimizing the interactions people have with interactive products to enable them to carry out their everyday activities.

Usability is a combination of:

- Ease of learning
- high speed of user task performance
- low user error rate
- subjective user satisfaction
- user retention over time

  

## Usability Goals

- Effective to use (effectiveness)
- Efficient to use (efficiency)
- Safe to use (safety)
- Having good utility (utility)
- Easy to learn (learnability
- Easy to remember how to use (memorability)

Usability goals are typically operationalized as questions. “is the system easy to learn” is not going to helpful. Be more detailed—”How long will it take a user to figure out how to use the most basic functions for a new smartwatch?”

  

### Effectiveness

> [!important] refers to how good a product is at doing what it is supposed to do

- Is the product capable of allowing people to learn, carry out their work efficiently, access the information that they need, or by the goods that they want?

### Efficiency

> [!important] refers to the way a product supports users in carrying out their tasks

- once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?

### Safety

> [!important] involves protecting the user from dangerous conditions and undesirable situations.

- Safe interactive systems should engender confidence and allow the user the opportunity to explore the interface to try new operations without the fear of breaking it.
- Implement safety mechanisms such as confirmation boxes
- what is the range of errors that are possible using the product, and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?

### Utility

> [!important] refers to the extent to which the product provides the right kind of functionality so that users can do what they need or want to do.

- does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all of their tasks in the way they want to do them?

### Learnability

> [!important] refers to how easy a system is to learn to use.

- people don’t like spending a long time learning how to use a system.
- is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying certain functions? how hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way?

### Memorability

> [!important] refers to how easy a product is to remember how to use, once learned.

- users shouldn’t have to keep relearning how to carry out tasks.
- what type of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?

# Design Evaluations

evaluations have subjective and objective metrics

Measurable metrics include:

- time to perform a task
- improvement of performance over time
- rate of errors by user
- retention over time
- subjective satisfaction

# User Interface Design

The goal is a user-centered design. the process of building a user-centered design is:

- Analyze user’s goals and tasks
- create design alternatives
- evaluate options
- implement prototype
- test
- refine
- implement
- loop back

  

# The User Experience

The user experience refers to how a product behaves and is used by people in the real world. Jakob Neilsen and Don Normal define it as encompassing “all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”

Every product that is used has user experience. More specificlaly, it is about how people feel about a product and their pleasure and satisfaction when using it, looking at it, holding it, and opning or closing it.

One cannot design a user experience, only design for a user experience. In particular one cannot design a sensual experience, but only create the design features that can evoke it.

It is not enough that we build products that function, that are understandable and usable, we also need to build joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and yes, beauty to people’s lives.

Of central importance are:

- usability
- functionality
- aesthetics
- content
- look and feel
- emotional appeal

Marc Hassenzahl’s 2010 model of UX is the most well known where he conceptualizes it in terms of pragmatic and hedonic aspects. By pragmatic, it is mean how simple, practical and obvious it is for the user to achieve their goals. By hedonic, it is meant how evocative and stimulating the interaction is to them.

  

# Understanding Users

One size does not fit all; what works for one user group may be totally inappropriate for another.

- Physical and cognitive abilities
- Personality and culture
- Knowledge and skills
- Motivation

Two Fatal Mistakes:

- Assume all users are alike
- Assume all users are like the designer or think like the designer

  

# Understanding the Problem Space

- what do you want to create?
- what are your assumptions?
- will it achieve what you hope it will?
