Data have quality if they satisfy the requirements of the intended use. There are many factors comprising data quality, including _**accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, believability, and interpretability.**_

  

Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data are common problems.

  

Raw data is often unprocessed. It may contain:

- obsolete/redundant fields
- missing values
- outliers
- data in form not suitable for data mining
- values not consistent with policy or common sense

For data mining purposes, database values must undergo data cleaning and data transformation

Data from legacy databases often have values that are:

- not looked at in years
- expired
- no longer relevant
- missing

We must minize GIGO (Garbage In → Garbage Out)

- IF Garbage into model is minimized → THEN Garbage results Out from model is minimized

Effort for data preparation around 10-60% of data mining process—depending in dataset.

# Major Tasks in Preprocessing

  

## Data Cleaning

- involves routines to “clean” the data by filling in missing values, smoothing noisy data, identifying or removing outliers, and resolving inconsistencies.
