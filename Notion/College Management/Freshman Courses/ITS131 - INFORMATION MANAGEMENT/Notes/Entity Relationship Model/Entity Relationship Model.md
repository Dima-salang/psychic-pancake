The ERM forms the basis of an ERD. The ERD represents the conceptual database as viewed by the end user. ERDs depict the database’s main components: entities, attributes, and relationships.

  

### Entities

- an entity is an object of interest to the end user. At the ER modeling level, an entity actually refers to the entity set and not to a single entity instance. In other words, an entity in the ERM corresponds to a table—not toa row— in the relational environment.
- In the Crow’s and UML notations, an entity is represented by a rectangle that contains the entity’s name. The entity name is usually written in all capital letters.

  

### Attributes

- are characteristics of entities.
- In the Crow’s Foot, the attributes are written in the attribute box below the entity rectangle.

![[/Untitled 27.png|Untitled 27.png]]

Required and Optional Attributes

- A required attribute is an attribute that must have a value. It is boldfaced in the Crow’s Foot.
- Optional attributes can be left empty.

Domains

- Attributes have domains.
- A domain is the set of possible values for a given attribute.
- Attributes may share a domain
- Contraints can be implemented to limit the domain.

Identifiers (Primary Keys)

- one or more attributes that uniquely identify each entity instance.
- Entities are mapped to tables and the entity identifier is mapped as the table’s primary key.
- Identifiers are underlined in the ERD. Key attributes are also underlined ina frequently shorthand notation for the table structure, called a relational schema.

Composite Identifiers

- A primary key composed of more than one attribute. Basically composite keys.

  

Composite and Simple Attributes

- Attributes can be classified as either simple or composite.
- A composite attribute is an attribute that can be further subdivided to yield additional attributes. Like ADDRESS can be further subdivided into STREET, CITY, BARANGAY, etc…
- A simple attribute is an attribute that cannot be subdivided.
- To facilitate detailed queries, it is wise to change composite attributes to a series of simple attributes. Database designers must be on the lookout for them.

Single-Valued Attributes

- is an attribute that can have only a single value.

  

Multivalued Attributes

- are attributes that can have many values

  

  

Derived Attributes

- is an attribute whose value is calculated from other attributes. The derived attribute need not be physically stored within the database; instead, it can be derived by using an algorithm.

## Relationships

- is an association between entities.
- The entities that participate in a relationship are also known as participants, and each relationships is identified by a name that describes the relationship.
    - Relationships between entities or the participants always operate on both directions.
        - A CUSTOMER may generate many INVOICEs
        - Each INVOICE is generated by one CUSTOMER
    - They use active or passive verbs.
        - a STUDENT takes a CLASS

  

## Connectivity and Cardinality

- The term connectivity is used to describe the relationship classification.
- Cardinality expresses the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of the related entity.
- In the ERD, cardinality is indicated by placing the appropriate numbers besie the entities using the format (x,y). The first value presents the minimum number of associated entities, while the second value represents the maximum.

![[/Untitled 2 10.png|Untitled 2 10.png]]

- Keep in mind that the cardinalities represent the number of occurrences in the related entity.
- The cardinality (1,4) next to the CLASS entity in the PROFESSOR teaches CLASS relationship indicates that each professor teaches up to four classes which means that the PROFESSOR table’s PK value occurs at least once and no more than four times as FK values in the CLASS table. If the cardinality had been written as (1,N), there would be no upper limit to the number of classes a professor might teach. Similarly, the cardinality (1,1) indicates that each class is taught by one and only one professor.
- Connectivity and maximum cardinality are related concepts. Connectivity is a half-vague answer to that question, while maximum cardinality is a specific answer to the same question. 1:M, Many is vague— it means any number greater than one.
- Similarly, participation and minimum cardinality also address the question of how few rows in one table may be associated with a row in the related table.
    - Participation is also a half-vague answer. If the fewest rows that must be related is zero, then participation is optional. If the fewest rows that must be related is anything greater than zero, then participation is mandatory
    - Participation does not specify exactly what the fewest number of rows is. Minimum cardinality provides the specific number.

  

  

## Existence Dependence

- An entity is said to be existence-dependent if it can exist in the database only when it is associated with another related entity occurrence. In implementation terms, an entity is existence-dependent if it has a mandatory foreign key—that is, an FK attribute that cannot be null.
- If an entity can exist apart from all of its related entities, then it is existence-independent, and it is referred to as a strong entity or regular entity.

  

## Relationship Strength

- the concept of relationship strengths is based on how the primary key of a related entity is defined. To implement a relationship, the PK of one entity (the parent entity) appears as an FK in the related entity or child entity.
    
      
    
    ### Weak (Non-Identifying Relationships)
    
    - exists if the PK of the related entity does not contain a PK component of the parent entity.
    - By default, relationships are established by having the PK of the parent entity appear as an FK on the related entity.
    
    ![[/Untitled 3 10.png|Untitled 3 10.png]]
    
    - In this case, a weak relationship exists because CRS_CODE is only an FK in the CLASS entity.
    
    ![[/Untitled 4 7.png|Untitled 4 7.png]]
    
      
    
    ### Strong (Identifying) Relationship
    
    - exists when the PK of the related entity contains a PK components of the parent entity.
    
    ![[/Untitled 5 7.png|Untitled 5 7.png]]
    
    - in this case, the CLASS entity PK is composed of CRS_CODE and CLASS_SECTION. There is a strong relationship. In other words, the CLASS PK did inherit a PK components from the COURSE entity.
    
    ![[/Untitled 6 7.png|Untitled 6 7.png]]
    
      
    
    > [!important] Keep in mind that the order in which the tables are created and loaded is important. It would not be acceptable to have the CLASS table’s FK refer to a COURSE table that did not yet exist. In fact, you must load the data of the “1” side first in a 1:M relationship to avoid the possibility of referential integrity errors, regardless of the relationships strength.
    
      
    
    ### Weak Entities
    
    - Conditions
        - Existence-dependent
        - Has a PK that partially or totally derived from parent entity in the relationship.
    - There can be weak entities within a strong relationship.

  

  

## Relationship Participation

  

Optional Participation

- One entity occurrence does not require a corresponding entity occurrence in a particular relationship.

![[/Untitled 7 5.png|Untitled 7 5.png]]

- A course is not required to have a class.

  

### Mandatory Participation

- One entity occurrence requires a corresponding entity occurrence in a particular relationship

![[/Untitled 8 4.png|Untitled 8 4.png]]

- For every COURSE, there should be a corresponding class to it.

  

  

## Relationship Degree

- indicates the number of entities or participants associated with a relationship.
- A unary relationship exists when an association is maintained within a single entity.
    - Example, the EMPLOYEE entity is the manager for one or more employees within that entity. In this case, the existence of the “manages” relationship means that EMPLOYEE requires another EMPLOYEE to be the manager. Such a relationship known as a recursive relationship.
- A binary relationship exists when two entities are associated.
    - In fact, to simplify the conceptual design, most higher-order relationships are decomposed into appropriate equivalent binary relationships whenever possible.
- A ternary exists when three entities are associated.
