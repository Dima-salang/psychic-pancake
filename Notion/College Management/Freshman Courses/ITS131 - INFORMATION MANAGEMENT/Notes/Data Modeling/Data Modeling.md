Database design focuses on how the database structure will be used to store and manage end-user data.

  

**Data modeling,** the first step in designing a database, refers to the process of creating a specific data model for a predetermined **problem domain (**a _problem domain_ is a clearly defined area within the real-world environment, with a well-defined scope and boundaries that will be systematically addressed.**)**

  

A data model is relatively simple representation, usually graphical, of more complex real-world data structures. In general terms, a model is an abstraction of a more complex- real-world object or event. A model’s main function is to help you understand the complexities of the real-world environment.

  

Within the database environment, a data model represents the data structures and their characteristics, relations, constraints, transformations, and other constructs with the purpose of supporting a specific problem domain.

  

Data modeling is an iterative, progressive process. You start with a simple understanding of the problem domain, and as your understanding increases, so does the level of detail of the data model. When done properly, the final data model effectively is a blueprint with all the instructions to build a database that will meet all end-user requirements.

  

This blueprint is supposed to be graphical and narrative in nature

- text descriptions in unambiguous language and useful diagrams.

  

  

## The Importance of Data Models

- Facilitates communication
- Gives various views of the database
- Organizes data for various users
- Provides an abstraction for the creation of a good database.

  

## Data Model Basic Building Blocks

  

### Entity

- is a person, place, thing, concept or even about which data will be collected and stored.
- An entity represents a particular type of object in the real world, which means an entity is “distinguishable”—that is, each entity occurrence is unique and distinct.
    - Example, CUSTOMER
- They can be physical but they can also be abstract such as FLIGHT_ROUTES or MUSICAL_CONCERTS

  

### Attribute

- is a characteristic of an entity
- a CUSTOMER entity would have last name, first name, phone address, etc…
- Attributes are the equivalent of fields in file systems.

  

### Relationship

- describes an association among entities.
- Data models use three types of relationships:
    - one-to-many or 1:M or 1..*
        - A painter creates many different paintings, but each is painted by only one painter. Thus, the painter (the ”one”) is related to the paintings (the ”many”).
        - Note that entity names are often capitalized as a convention. Similarly, a customer may generate many invoices, but each invoice is generated by only a single customer. The CUSTOMER generates INVOICE relationship would also be labeled 1:M
    - many-to-many or 1:M or M:N or *..*
        - An employee may learn many job skills, and each job skill may be learned by many employees
    - and one-to-one or 1:1 or 1..1
        - A retail; company’s management structure may require that each of its stores be managed by a single employee. in turn,e ach store manager, who is an employee, manages only a single store.
- Relationships are bidirecional
    - ONe CUSTOMER can generate many INVOICEs
    - Each of the many INVOICEs is generated by only one CUSTOMER

### Constraints

- is a restriction placed on the data. Important to ensure data integrity. Normally expressed in the form of rules.

  

  

## Business Rules

- From a database point of view, the collection of data becomes meaningful only when it reflects properly defined business rules.
- A business rule is a brief, precise, and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure, or principle within a specific organization. In a sense, tey are misnamed: they can apply to any organization.
- Properly written business rules are used to define the data elements.
- The main sources of business rules are company managers, policy makers, department managers, and written documentation.
- The process of identifying and documenting business rules is essential to database design
    - It helps to standardize the company’s view of data
    - It can be a communication tool
    - it allows the designer to understand the nature, role, and scope of the data
    - it allows the designer to understand business processes
    - it allows the designer to develop appropriate relationship participation rules and constraints and to create an accurate data model.

  

### Translating Business Rules Into Data Model Components

- In general, a noun in a business rule will translate into an entity in the model, and a verb that associates the nouns will translate into a relationship among the entities.
- To properly identity the type of relationship, you should consider that relationships are bidirectional.

  

  

### Naming Conventions

  

Entity name requirements

- Be descriptive of the objects in the business environment
- User terminology familiar to the end users

  

Attribute Name

- required to be descriptive of the data represented by the attribute

  

Importance of proper naming

- Facilitates communication between parties
- Promotes self-documentation

  

  

## The Evolution of Data Models

- These models represent schools of thought as to what a database is, what is should do, the types of structures that it should employ, and the technology to be used.

### Hierarchical and Network Models

- was developed in the 1960s to manage large amounts of data for complex manufacturing projects.
- THw modell’s basic logical structure is represented by an upside-down tree.
- The hierarchical structure contains levels, or segments. A segment is the equivalent of a file system’s record type.
- There is also the child and parents which have a 1:M relationships.

![[/Untitled 26.png|Untitled 26.png]]

Advantages

- promotes data sharing and easy to understand
- parent/child relationship promotes conceptual simplicity and data integrity
- Efficient with 1:M relationships

  

Disadvantages

- requires knowledge of physical data storage characteristics
- Navigational system requires knowledge of hierarchical path
- changes in structure require changes in all application programs
- implementation limitations
- no data definition
- lack of standards

  

  

### Network Model

- in the network model, the user perceives the network database as a collection of records in 1:M relationships
- However, unlike the hierarchical model, the network model allows a record to have more than one parent.
- While the network database model is generally not used today, the definitions of standard database concepts that emerged with he network model are still used by modern data models.
    
    - The **schema** is the conceptual organization of the entire database as viewed by the DBA
    - The **subschema** defines the portion of the database “seen” by the application programs that actually produce the desired information from the data within the database.
    - A data manipulation language or DML defines the environment in which data can be managed and is used to work with the data in the database.
    - A schema data definition language of DDL enables the database administrator to define the schema components.
    
      
    

### The Relational Model

- the relational model was introduced in 1970 by E.F. Codd of IBM in his paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Databanks”.
- The relational model’s foundation is a mathematical concept known as a **relation**. You can think of a relation (sometimes called a table) as a two-dimensional structure composed of intersecting rows and columns. Each row in a relation is called a tuple. Each column represents an attribute.
- The relational model is implemented through a relational database management system or RDBMS.
- Arguably the most important function of the RDMBS is its ability to hide complexity. The RDBMS manages all of the physical details, while the user sees the relational database as a collection of tables in which data is stored. The user can manipulate and query the data in a way that seems intuitive and logical. Tables are related to each other through the sharing of a common attribute.
- Most DBMS products are RDBMS, meaning that they employ the relational data model.
- The relational model provides a minimum level of controlled redundancy to eliminate most of the redundancies commonly found in file systems.
- A relational diagram is a graphical representation of a relational database’s entities, the attributes within those entities, and the relationships among the entities.
- A relational table stores a collection of related entities. A table yields complete data and structural independence because it is a purely logical structure. How the data is physically stored in the database is of no concern to the end user or designer, the perception is what counts.
- Most relational database software uses SQL. From an end-user perspective, any SQL-based relational database application involves:
    - The end-user interface
    - A collection of tables stored in the database
    - SQL engine - largely hidden fro the end user, the SQL engine executes all queries, or data requests.

  

### The Entity Relationship Model

- the relational model still lacked the features
- Database designers prefer to use a graphical tool in which entities and their relationships are pictured.
- Peter Chen first introduced the ER data model in 1976. It complemented the relational data model concepts.
- ER models are normally represented in an entity relationship diagram or ERD, which uses graphical representations to model database component.
    - Entity - represented by a rectangle, also known as an entity box. The name of the entity, is written in the center of the rectangle. The entity name is generally written in capital letters and in singular form. Usually, when applying the ERD to the relational model, an entity is mapped to a relational table. Each row in the relational table is known as an entity instance or entity occurrence in the ER model.
    - Attributes
    - Relationships - the ER model uses the term connectivity to label the relationship types.

  

![[/Untitled 1 13.png|Untitled 1 13.png]]

The ER model’s visual simplicity makes it the dominant database modeling and design tools.

  

  

### The Object-Oriented Model (OODM)

- both data and its relationships are contained in a single structure known as an object. In turn, the OODM is the basis for the object-oriented database management system (OODBMS).
- quite unlike an entity, an object includes information about relationships between facts within the object, as well as information about its relationships with other objects. Subsequnt OODM development has allowed an object also to contain all operations that can be performed on it. The object becomes self-contained, thus making it a basic building block for autonomous structures. it is based on the following structures
    
    - an object is an abstraction of a real-world entity. in general terms, an object may be considered equivalent to an ER model’s entity. More precisely only one occurrence of an entity.
    - Attributes
    - Class is a collection of similar objects with shared structure (attributes) and behavior (methods). A class’s method represents a real-world action.
    - Classes are organized in a class hierarchy. The class hierarchy resembles an upside-down tree in each class has only one parent.
    - Inheritance is the ability of an object within the class hierarchy to inherit the attributes and methods of the classes above it.
    - OO data models are typically depicted using UML class diagrams. UML is language based on OO concepts that describe a set of diagrams and symbols to graphically model a system.
    
      
    
      
    

### Object/Relational and XMl

- Extended relational data model or ERDM. The ERDM gave birth to a new generation of relational databases that support OO features. A DBMS based on the ERDM is often described as an object/relational database management system (O/R DBMS)
- Today, most relational database products can be classified as object/relational. From the start, the OO and relational data models were developed in response to different problem. OO for engineering and relational for data management. This is why the market for OO in DBMS did not rapidly grow.
- The use of complete objects received a boost with the Internet revolution. Within this environment, Extensible Markup Language or XML emerged as the de facto standard for the efficient and effective exchange of data.

  

### Emerging Data Models: Big Data and NoSQL

- The web of interconnected devices exchanging and collecting data is known as the Internet of Things or IoT.
- Big Data refers to a movement to find new and better ways to manage large amounts of web- and sensor-generated data and derive business insight from it, while simultaneously providing high performance and scalability at a reasonable cost. Douglas Laney, a data analyst from the Gartner Group first described the basic characteristics of Big Data databases: the 3 Vs.
    - **Volume** refers to the amount of data being stored
    - **Velocity** refers not only to the speed with which data grows but also to the need to process this data quickly in order to generate information and insight.
    - **Variety** refers to the fact that the data being collected comes in multiple data formats.

  

The problem is that the relational approach does not always match the needs of organizations with Big Data challenges.

- it is not always possible to fit unstructured data into tables
- adding millions of rows of multiformat data on a daily basis will lead to the need for more storage, processing power, and data analysis tools which all come at hefty prices.
- mining for usable data in the vast amounts of unstructured data collected requires a different approach.

  

Some of the most frequently used Big Data technologies are:

- Hadoop is a Java-based, open-source, high-speed, fault toleratn distributed storage and computational framework. Hadoop uses low-cost hardware to create clusters of thousands of computer nodes to store and process data.
    - Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS is a highly distributed, fault-tolerant file storage system designed to manage large amounts of data at high speeds. in order to achieve high throughput, HDFS uses the write-once, read many model. This means that once the data is written, it cannot be modified. HDFs uses three types of nodes: a name node that stores all the metadata about the file system, a data node that stores a fixed-size data blocks, and a client node that acts as the interface between the user application and the HDFS.
    - MapReduce is an open source API that provides fast data analytics services.
- NoSQL is a large-scale distributed database system that stores structured and unstructured data in efficient ways.

## Degrees of Data Abstraction

- a database designer starts with an abstract view of the overall data environment and adds details as the design comes closer to implementation.
- In the early 1970s, the American National Standards Institutes or ANSI defined a framework for data modeling based on degrees of data abstraction.

  

![[/Untitled 3 9.png|Untitled 3 9.png]]

  

  

### The External Model

- is the end user’s view of the data environment. End users usually operate in an environment in which an application has a specific business unit focus. Each unit is subject to specific constraints and requirements, and each one uses a subset of the overall data in the organization. Therefore, end users within those business units view their data subsets as separate from or external to other units within the organization.
- Because data is being modeled, ER diagrams will be used to represent the external views. A specific representation of an external view is known as an external schema.

![[/Untitled 4 6.png|Untitled 4 6.png]]

  

### Conceptual Model

- represents a global view of the entire database by the entire organization. That is, the conceptual model integrates all external views into a single global view of the data in the enterprise.
- Also known as a conceptual schema, itis the basis for the identification and high-level description of the main data objects. THe most widely used conceptual model is the ER model through ERDs.
- Advantages
    - Provides a bird-eye view or macro level view of the data environment.
    - the conceptual model is independent of both software and hardware. Software independence means that the model does not depend on the DBMS software used to implement the model. Hardware independence means that the model does not depend on the hardware used in the implementation of the model. Generally, the term logical design refers to the task of creating a conceptual data model that could be implemented in any DBMS.

![[/Untitled 5 6.png|Untitled 5 6.png]]

  

### Internal Model

- Once a specific DBMS has been selected, the internal model maps the conceptual model to the DBMS. The internal; model is the representation of the database as seen by the DBMS. In other words, the internal model requires the designer to match the conceptual model’s characteristics and constraints to those of the selected implementation model.
- An internal schema depicts a specific representation of an internal model, using the database constructs supported by the chosen database
- In a relational database, the internal schema should map the conceptual model to the relational model constructs. In particular, the entities in the conceptual model are mapped to the tables in the relational model. Likewise, because a relational database has been selected, the internal schema is expressed using SQL.

![[/Untitled 6 6.png|Untitled 6 6.png]]

- Because the internal model depends on the specific database software, it is said to be software dependent. Therefore a change in the DBMS software requires that the internal model be changed to fit the characteristics and requirements of the implementation database model. However, the internal model is still hardware independent.
- When you change the internal model without affecting the conceptual model, you have logical independence.

  

### The Physical Model

- Operates at the lowest level of abstraction, describing the way data is saved on storage media.
- THe physical model requires the definition both the physical storage devices and the access methods required to reach the data within those storage devices, making it both software and hardware dependent.
- Early data models forced the database designers to take the details of the physical model’s data storage requirements into account. Now, it is focused largely at the logical level.
