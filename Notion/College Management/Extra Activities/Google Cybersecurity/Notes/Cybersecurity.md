# Cybersecurity

- the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

  

## Threat Actor

- any person or group who presents a security risk

  

Cybersecurity is especially crucial in today’s world where data breaches can happen

  

# Benefits of Security

- protects against external and internal threats
- meets regulatory compliance
- maintains and improves business productivity
- reduces expenses
- maintain brand trust

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

- any information used to infer an individual’s identity
    - full name
    - IP address
    - address

  

## Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)

- a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
    
    - SSS
    - Medical or financial info
    - biometric data
    
      
    

These two key assets are the primary concerns when a data breach occurs within an organization. Identity theft is primary concern.

- malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

  

### Malware

- software designed to harm devices or networks

  

  

# Attacks in the digital age

- one example is the LoveLetter or the ILY virus.

  

### Social Engineering

- a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- the ILY virus was a product of social engineering

  

  

### Phishing

- is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include:

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
- **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## Malware

**Malware** is software designed to harm devices or networks. There are many types of malware. The primary purpose of malware is to obtain money, or in some cases, an intelligence advantage that can be used against a person, an organization, or a territory.

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include:

- **Viruses:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
- **Worms:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **Ransomware:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

## Social Engineering

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question. It’s the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible.

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **Social media phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
- **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.
- **Physical social engineering:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

### **Social engineering principles**

Social engineering is incredibly effective. This is because people are generally trusting and conditioned to respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is increasing with every new social media application that allows public access to people's data. Although sharing personal data—such as your location or photos—can be convenient, it’s also a risk.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited _over time_. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

## Threat actor types

### **Advanced persistent threats**

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources
- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

### **Insider threats**

Insider threats abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Sabotage
- Corruption
- Espionage
- Unauthorized data access or leaks

### **Hacktivists**

Hacktivists are threat actors that are driven by a political agenda. They abuse digital technology to accomplish their goals, which may include:

- Demonstrations
- Propaganda
- Social change campaigns
- Fame

  

  

A **hacker** is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

- Authorized hackers are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.
- Semi-authorized hackers are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.
- Unauthorized hackers are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain.
