# **Cache Replacement Policies: Choosing What to Evict**

When a **set in a cache is full**, we must **evict** a block to make space for new data. But **which block should be replaced?** That’s where **cache replacement policies** come into play.

---

## **🔹 Why Do We Need Replacement Policies?**

In **set-associative** and **fully-associative** caches, each set contains **multiple slots (ways)**. If a **new block** needs to be placed but all slots are occupied, we must **choose a block to evict**.

The right **replacement policy** can significantly affect **cache performance** by **minimizing cache misses**.

---

# **🔹 1. Least Recently Used (LRU) 🚀**

📌 **Evict the block that hasn’t been used for the longest time.**

### **🔍 How It Works**

- Keep track of **access history**.
- When a new block is inserted and the set is full, **remove the block that was used the longest time ago**.
- **Good for:** Programs with predictable memory access patterns.

### **🛠️ Example**

Let’s say a **2-way set-associative cache** has this state:

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block A (Last Used 3ms ago) ] [ Block B (Last Used 1ms ago) ]
```

Now, a new block **C** needs to be inserted into **Set 0**.

- Since **Block A was used the longest time ago**, we **evict A** and replace it with **C**.

✅ **Updated Cache:**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block C (Newly Inserted) ] [ Block B (Still in Cache) ]
```

### **✅ Pros**

✔ Works well when **old data is less likely to be reused**.

✔ Great for **loop-heavy** programs where recent accesses matter.

### **❌ Cons**

❌ Requires **extra bookkeeping** (linked lists, counters, or stack).

❌ **Slightly expensive to implement** in hardware.

# **🔹 2. First-In, First-Out (FIFO) 🏷️**

📌 **Evict the oldest inserted block, regardless of usage frequency.**

### **🔍 How It Works**

- Each set is treated like a **queue**.
- When a new block needs to be inserted, **remove the oldest block in the set**.
- **Good for:** Simple hardware implementations.

### **🛠️ Example**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block X (Inserted 10ms ago) ] [ Block Y (Inserted 5ms ago) ]
```

Now, we need to insert **Block Z**.

- Since **Block X was inserted first**, we **evict X** and insert **Z**.

✅ **Updated Cache:**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block Z (Newly Inserted) ] [ Block Y (Still in Cache) ]
```

### **✅ Pros**

✔ **Simple to implement** (just track insertion order).

✔ **Low overhead** in hardware.

### **❌ Cons**

❌ Can **evict frequently used data**, leading to **more cache misses**.

❌ **Not ideal** for workloads where old data is still relevant.

# **🔹 3. Random Replacement 🎲**

📌 **Evict a randomly selected block in the set.**

### **🔍 How It Works**

- Pick **any block in the set** at random and replace it.
- No need for complex tracking or history.

### **🛠️ Example**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block P ] [ Block Q ]
```

A new block **R** needs to be inserted.

- The system **randomly picks** between **P and Q** to evict.

✅ **Updated Cache:**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block R ] [ Block Q ]  (or maybe [ Block P ] [ Block R ])
```

### **✅ Pros**

✔ **Fastest & simplest** to implement in hardware.

✔ **Sometimes performs surprisingly well**, especially when access patterns are unpredictable.

### **❌ Cons**

❌ Can **randomly evict a heavily used block**, leading to unnecessary cache misses.

---

# **🔹 4. Least Frequently Used (LFU) 📊**

📌 **Evict the block that has been used the least.**

### **🔍 How It Works**

- Each block **maintains a counter** of how often it has been accessed.
- The block with the **lowest counter** is evicted.

### **🛠️ Example**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block M (Accessed 10 times) ] [ Block N (Accessed 2 times) ]
```

A new block **O** arrives.

- Since **Block N was used less**, we **evict N**.

✅ **Updated Cache:**

```Plain
Set 0: [ Block M ] [ Block O ]
```

### **✅ Pros**

✔ Works well when some data is **rarely used** and can be safely evicted.

✔ More **intelligent** than FIFO or random.

### **❌ Cons**

❌ **Expensive to track** usage counts.

❌ **Not always optimal** (a block may have been used often in the past but is now useless).

---

# **🔹 5. Pseudo-LRU (PLRU) 🏎️**

📌 **A simplified version of LRU that approximates the least recently used block.**

### **🔍 How It Works**

- Instead of tracking exact usage history, **it uses binary trees or bit flags** to estimate the least-recently-used block.
- **Common in modern CPUs** because it's **cheaper than full LRU** but still effective.

### **✅ Pros**

✔ **Much simpler & faster** than full LRU.

✔ **Performs nearly as well as LRU in most cases.**

### **❌ Cons**

❌ **Less accurate** than true LRU.

## **🔹 Which Policy is Best?**

It depends on the workload:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Policy**|**Best for...**|**Weakness**|
|**LRU**|Loops & predictable memory patterns|Expensive in hardware|
|**FIFO**|Simple designs|Can evict useful data|
|**Random**|Unpredictable workloads|Can remove important blocks|
|**LFU**|Repeated access to the same data|Hard to implement efficiently|
|**PLRU**|High-performance CPUs|Slightly less optimal than LRU|

---

## **🔹 Real-World Applications**

📌 **Modern CPUs (Intel, AMD, ARM)**

- **L1 cache** → Uses **LRU or PLRU**
- **L2 cache** → Uses **PLRU or FIFO**
- **L3 cache** → Often **Random or FIFO** for simplicity

📌 **Operating Systems (TLBs, Virtual Memory)**

- TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) often uses **LRU** or **Random** replacement.

📌 **Databases (MySQL, Redis, Web Caching)**

- Redis supports **LFU** and **LRU** for efficient eviction.
- Web caches like **CDNs** (Cloudflare, Akamai) use **LRU** for frequently accessed web pages.

---

## **🚀 Final Thoughts**

✔ **LRU is the most effective** but costly to implement.

✔ **FIFO is simple** but can make bad eviction choices.

✔ **Random is surprisingly good** for unpredictable access patterns.

✔ **PLRU is a compromise** between LRU and efficiency.
