  

## **Authentication:**

- **Definition:** The process of proving one's identity, often through a username and password.
- **Identification vs. Authentication:**
    - **Identification:** Describing an entity uniquely (e.g., email address).
    - **Authentication:** Proving one is who they claim to be (e.g., supplying a password).
- **Relation to Authorization:** Authentication is distinct from authorization (authn vs. authz). Authz pertains to the resources and permissions an authenticated identity has.
- **Password Strength:**
    - **Weak Password:** Short and simple, vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.
    - **Strong Password:** Longer, complex, includes numbers, uppercase letters, and special characters.

## **2. Security vs. Usability:**

- **Trade-Off:** Security often involves a trade-off with usability.
- **Password Example:** More complex passwords are more secure but less memorable, highlighting the balance needed.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Security aims to mitigate risks rather than completely eliminate them.
- **Extreme Example:** The most secure system might be useless due to its extreme isolation.

## **3. Password Policies:**

- **Organization's Role:** IT support specialists play a key role in ensuring strong passwords and good password hygiene.
- **Password Policy Elements:**
    - **Length Requirements**
    - **Character Complexity**
    - **Avoidance of Dictionary Words**
    - **No Writing Down or Sharing of Passwords**
- **Password Rotation:** Recommended for safeguarding against potential compromises, but periods shouldn't be too short to avoid user inconvenience.

## **4. Balancing Security and Convenience:**

- **Challenge:** Balancing security measures to be effective without causing significant inconvenience to users.
- **User Behavior:** Inconvenient policies may lead to poor security behaviors, such as writing down passwords.
- **Password Complexity and Rotation:** Should be balanced to ensure both security and user compliance.

    - **Identity Provider:** Users authenticate through a third-party service.
    - **Process:**
        
        - Relying party looks up OpenID provider.
        - Establishes shared secret with the provider.
        - Redirects user to the identity provider's login flow.
        - User confirms trust with the relying party.
        - Token (not actual credentials) indicates user authentication to the service.
        
          
        
    
    **OAuth: Delegated Access Authorization**
    
    1. **OAuth Overview:**
        - Open standard facilitating access delegation without sharing account credentials.
        - Users grant third-party applications access to specific account information.
        - OAuth prompts users to confirm access requests, listing requested information or permissions.
    2. **Example: Third-Party Meme Creation Website:**
        - Site uses OAuth to request permission to send memes via the user's email account.
        - User approves, and the email provider issues an access token with defined scopes (e.g., only for email access).
    3. **Security Considerations:**
        - **Phishing Attacks:** OAuth authorization requests can be exploited in phishing attacks.
        - Users must scrutinize access requests and be aware of potential risks.
