- Cryptography, the art of hiding messages, has evolved through the ages, from ancient methods to modern computer-based encryption.

**Components of Encryption**

1. **Cipher Basics**
    - Encryption involves transforming plaintext into unreadable ciphertext through a cipher.
    - The reverse process, decryption, turns ciphertext back into readable plaintext.
2. **Cipher Components**
    - A cipher comprises an encryption algorithm and a key.
    - Encryption algorithm: Complex mathematical operation converting plaintext to ciphertext.
    - Key: Introduces uniqueness; without it, decoding is possible, and secrecy is compromised.
3. **Cipher Creation**
    - Select an encryption algorithm and a unique key.
    - Run plaintext through the cipher to generate encrypted ciphertext.
    - The process ensures a secure message ready for transmission.

**Security Through Obscurity**

- Keeping the algorithm secret is termed "security through obscurity."
- Analogy: Hiding a house key under a doormat.
- Critique: Fragile security; once the hidden information is discovered, security is compromised.

**Kerckhoff's Principle**

- The overarching concept: A cryptosystem remains secure even if all details are known except the key.
- Also known as Shannon's maxim or "the enemy knows the system."
- Emphasizes the centrality of key security in ensuring overall system security.

**Cryptology and Cryptanalysis**

- Cryptography: The practice of coding and hiding messages.
- Cryptology: The study of cryptographic practices.

**Defending the Digital Fortress: Hashing Strategies Unveiled**

In the intricate realm of cryptographic hashing, understanding the nuances of attacks and robust defense mechanisms is crucial. Let's delve into the tactics employed to secure sensitive information, especially in the realm of user authentication.

**Authentication and Hashing: A Secure Duo**

- **Scenario:** When you log into your email account, the system must verify your password.
- **Problematic Approach:** Storing passwords in plain text is a security disaster, making all accounts vulnerable if the system is compromised.
- **Secure Solution:** Store a hash of the password instead of the password itself.
- **Verification:** The entered password is hashed, and the resulting hash is compared with the stored hash for authentication.

**The Brute Force Conundrum**

- **Threat:** Brute force attacks involve trying all possible input values until a hash match is found.
- **Challenge:** Technically, brute force attacks are impossible to protect against completely.
- **Defense:** Raise the computational bar, making it time and resource-intensive beyond practical feasibility.
- **Strategy:** Increase the computational load by running the password through the hashing function multiple times (iterations).

**Rainbow Tables: A Spectrum of Danger**

- **Concept:** Precomputed tables storing all possible password values and their corresponding hashes.
- **Objective:** Trade computational power for disk space by storing precomputed hashes.
- **Attack Speed:** Faster than brute force as the attacker looks up the hash in the rainbow table.
- **Defense:** Introduce salts to make precomputed rainbow tables infeasible.

**The Role of Salts: A Dash of Security**

- **Definition:** A password salt is additional randomized data added to the password before hashing.
- **Function:** The salt ensures that the hash is unique to the password and salt combination.
- **Implementation:** Concatenate or attach a randomly chosen large salt to the password before hashing.
- **Implication:** Attackers must compute a rainbow table for each possible salt value, making large salts a powerful defense.

**Salt Sizes: A Matter of Complexity**

- **Early Systems:** UNIX systems used a 12-bit salt, leading to 4096 possible salts.
- **Modern Systems:** Linux, BSD, and Solaris utilize a 128-bit salt, resulting in over 340 undecillion (340 with 36 zeros) possible salt values.
- **Impact:** A 128-bit salt raises the bar to the point where generating useful rainbow tables becomes practically infeasible.

### **c. Renewal and Revocation:**

- **Renewal:** Certificates have a finite lifespan and need periodic renewal to ensure continued trust.
- **Revocation:** In case of compromise or other issues, certificates can be revoked by the CA.

### **d. Trust Chain:**

- **Verification:** When a user visits a website, their browser verifies the digital certificate's authenticity.
- **Chain of Trust:** The certificate chain, including the website's certificate and any intermediate CA certificates, is verified up to a trusted root certificate stored in the browser.

  

When a client (such as a web browser) receives a digital certificate from a server, it verifies the entire chain of certificates, commonly known as the "certificate chain" or "certificate path." The purpose of this verification process is to establish trust and ensure the authenticity of the presented certificate.

Here's how the certificate chain verification works:

1. **End-Entity Certificate (Server Certificate):**
    - The server presents its digital certificate (end-entity certificate) to the client during the SSL/TLS handshake.
2. **Intermediate CA Certificates:**
    - The server's certificate is often issued by an Intermediate CA. The server provides not only its own certificate but also the entire chain of intermediate CA certificates up to, but not including, the Root CA certificate.
    - These intermediate CA certificates form the links in the chain between the end-entity certificate and the Root CA.
3. **Root CA Certificate:**
    - The client already possesses a pre-installed set of trusted Root CA certificates. These are distributed by the operating system or browser vendors.
    - The Root CA certificate, however, is not transmitted during the SSL/TLS handshake. Instead, the client relies on the pre-existing trust in the Root CAs.
4. **Verification Process:**
    - The client verifies the digital signature on each certificate in the chain, starting from the end-entity certificate and moving up to the Root CA.
    - This involves checking that each certificate is signed by the private key of the next higher certificate in the chain.
5. **Revocation Checks:**
    - The client may perform checks to ensure that none of the certificates in the chain has been revoked.
    - This is typically done by consulting Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or using Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses.
6. **Expiration Checks:**
    - The client also checks the expiration dates of each certificate in the chain to ensure that they are still within their validity period.
7. **Trust Establishment:**
    - If the entire chain is successfully verified, and each certificate is trusted, the client establishes trust in the presented server certificate.
    - The padlock icon or other indicators in the browser signify that the connection is secured and the server is authenticated.

This also prevents MIM attacks as the whole chain is verified.

  

  

## **1. HTTPS (SSL/TLS for Web Security):**

- **Definition:** HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP (Hypertext Transport Protocol).
- **Encryption Protocol:** It encapsulates HTTP traffic over an encrypted channel using SSL or TLS.
- **SSL Deprecation:** SSL 3.0 was deprecated in 2015, and TLS is now the standard protocol for secure communications.
- **TLS Functions:** Provides secure communication, authentication of parties, and ensures the integrity of communications.
- **TLS Applications:** Used not only for web browsing but also for securing VoIP calls, email, instant messaging, and Wi-Fi network security.

## **2. TLS Handshake:**

- **Initiation:** Begins with a ClientHello message from the client.
- **Server Response:** ServerHello, along with its digital certificate and ServerHelloDone message.
- **Client Validation:** Validates the server's certificate.
- **Key Exchange:** ClientKeyExchange message for securely establishing a shared secret.
- **Secure Communication:** ChangeCipherSpec message indicates the switch to secure communication.
- **Completion:** Encrypted Finished messages from both client and server confirm the handshake's success.

## **3. Forward Secrecy:**

- **Session Key:** Derived from the public-private key exchange.
- **Private Key Compromise:** Forward secrecy ensures that even if the private key is compromised, previously transmitted messages remain secure.

## **4. SSH (Secure Shell):**

- **Purpose:** Secure network protocol for remote login to command-line-based systems.
- **Flexibility:** Allows arbitrary network ports and traffic to be tunneled over an encrypted channel.
- **Origins:** Developed as a secure replacement for unsecured remote login Shell protocols.
- **Authentication:** Uses public key cryptography for server authentication and user authentication via client certificates.

## **5. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):**

- **Definition:** Encryption application for data authentication and privacy.
- **Uses:** Commonly used for encrypted email communication, full disk encryption, and encrypting files and documents.
- **Development:** Created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.
- **Export Restrictions:** Faced US federal export restrictions due to encryption technology classification.
- **Security:** Widely regarded as very secure with no known cryptographic or computational vulnerabilities.
- **Algorithm Evolution:** Originally used RSA, later replaced with DSA to avoid licensing issues.

  

  

## **1. Trusted Platform Module (TPM):**

- **Definition:** A hardware device integrated into computer hardware, serving as a dedicated crypto processor.
- **Functions:**
    - **Secure Key Generation:** TPMs generate secure keys and assist in random number generation.
    - **Remote Attestation:** Authenticates software and hardware configurations to a remote system.
    - **Data Binding and Sealing:** Uses a secret hardware-backed encryption key for data encryption, binding it to the TPM.
- **Implementation:** Can be a discrete hardware chip, integrated into another chip, implemented in firmware or software, or virtualized in a hypervisor.
- **Security Levels:** Discrete chips are the most secure due to physical tamper resistance.

## **2. Secure Elements and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):**

- **Secure Elements (Mobile Devices):** Tamper-resistant chips embedded in mobile devices for secure key storage.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):** An isolated execution environment alongside the main OS, providing enhanced security and isolation for applications.

## **3. Criticism of TPMs:**

- **Manufacturer Trust:** TPMs have faced criticism regarding the trust placed in manufacturers, as the secret key is burned into the hardware during manufacturing.
- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** Physical attacks on TPMs have been demonstrated, requiring specialized equipment.

## **4. Full Disk Encryption (FDE):**

- **Definition:** Encrypting the entire drive of a system to protect all contents from data theft or tampering.
