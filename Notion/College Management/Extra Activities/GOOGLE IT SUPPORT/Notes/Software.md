**Software Licensing Models:**

- Commercial software often requires users to purchase licenses for usage.
- Non-commercial software can be made open source, allowing free sharing, modification, and distribution by developers.
- Examples of successful open-source projects include the Linux kernel, LibreOffice, GIMP, and Firefox.

**Types of Software:**

- **Application Software:** Designed to fulfill specific needs, such as text editors, web browsers, and graphic editors.
- **System Software:** Supports the core functioning of a computer system, including operating system tools and utilities.
- **Firmware:** Software permanently stored on computer components, such as the BIOS, responsible for hardware initialization and OS loading.

**Software Versions:**

- Software versions help identify the features and updates included in a specific iteration.
- Versions are typically denoted with sequential numbering, with higher numbers indicating newer versions.

  

Through abstraction, we can write software without dealing with the complexity of hardware.

  

**Programming Evolution Timeline:**

- In the 1950s, early computer scientists used punch cards to store and execute programs, which were written in binary code.
- Assembly language was introduced as a more human-readable alternative to writing programs, but it still closely resembled machine code.
- Assembly language allowed for some level of abstraction but was specific to certain CPU architectures.
- Compiled programming languages were developed to provide a higher level of abstraction. Programmers write human-readable code, which is then compiled into machine instructions by a compiler.
- Interpreted languages then came to run code just in time.

  

  

**Software Updates and Changes:**

- Software is constantly evolving with updates and changes released by developers and companies.
- Updates may introduce new features, enhance security, and improve compatibility.
- It's essential to test software updates before deploying them in a workplace to avoid compatibility issues or disruptions.

**Managing Software:**

- Old or outdated software can pose security risks due to vulnerabilities.
- Regularly updating software helps ensure security and compatibility.
- Software management involves installing, updating, and, if necessary, removing software.

**Security Considerations:**

- Software bugs can lead to unexpected errors and security vulnerabilities.
- Malicious software, such as malware, can harm your computer or network.
- It's crucial to install software from reputable sources and exercise caution when granting installation permissions.

**Administrator Approval:**

- In many organizations, users are not allowed to install software without administrator approval.
- This practice helps maintain control over the software environment and prevent unauthorized or potentially harmful installations.
