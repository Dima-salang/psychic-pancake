**1. Changing Directories**

- Changing directories (folders) is a fundamental task when navigating a file system in a command-line environment.
- On Windows, the command for changing directories is `**cd**` (short for "change directory").

**2. Absolute Path**

- An absolute path specifies the full directory hierarchy starting from the main directory or root directory (e.g., C:).
- It provides a complete path to the target directory.
- For example: `**cd C:\Users\Cindy\Desktop**` will take you to the Desktop directory under the user Cindy.

**3. Relative Path**

- A relative path specifies the directory hierarchy relative to your current location.
- It provides a path based on your current directory.
- Relative paths are useful for navigating directories without specifying the entire path.
- For example: `**cd ..**` will move you up one level in the directory tree.

  

**Navigating Directories in PowerShell**

**1. Current Directory and Prompt**

- When you open PowerShell, you start in your home directory by default.
- The command prompt displays your current directory.
- You can check your current directory using the `**pwd**` (print working directory) command.

**2. Changing Directories**

- To navigate between directories, you use the `**cd**` (change directory) command followed by the path to the directory you want to change to.
- The path can be either absolute (starting from the root directory) or relative (based on your current location).

**3. Absolute Path**

- An absolute path specifies the full directory hierarchy, starting from the root directory (e.g., `**C:\**` in Windows).
- Example: `**cd C:\Users\Cindy\Documents**` changes to the Documents directory using an absolute path.

**4. Relative Path**

- A relative path specifies the directory hierarchy relative to your current location.
- Example: `**cd ..**` moves up one level in the directory tree to the parent directory.

**5. Commands and Functions**

- `**cd**` **(Change Directory)**:
    - Function: Allows you to change the current working directory.
    - Example: `**cd C:\Users\Cindy\Documents**` changes the current directory to Documents using an absolute path.
- `**..**` **(Double Dot)**:
    - Function: Represents the parent directory.
    - Example: `**cd ..**` moves up one level in the directory tree, navigating to the parent directory.
- `**.**` **(Single Dot)**:
    - Function: Represents the current directory.
    - Example: `**cd .**` has no effect and keeps you in the current directory.
- `**\**` **(Backslash)**:
    - Function: Used to separate directory names in Windows paths.
    - Example: `**C:\Users\Cindy\Documents**` uses backslashes to denote the directory structure.
- `**~**` **(Tilde)**:
    - Function: A shortcut for the path to your home directory.
    - Example: `**cd ~\Desktop**` navigates to the Desktop folder in your home directory.

**6. Tab Completion**

- PowerShell features tab completion, a useful auto-completion feature.
- Pressing the **Tab key** while typing a directory or file name will auto-complete it if there's a unique match.
- If there are multiple matches, tab completion will cycle through options.
- Tab completion simplifies typing and minimizes errors when navigating directories.

**7. Efficient Navigation**

- PowerShell provides shortcuts like `**cd ~**` for your home directory and `**cd ..**` for the parent directory.
- You can use tab completion to quickly select directories and files without typing out their entire names.

  

# **Navigating Directories in Bash**

1. **Current Directory**: You start in your home directory by default.
2. `**pwd**` **(Print Working Directory)**: Shows your current directory.
3. `**cd**` **(Change Directory)**:
    - Use `**cd <path>**` to change the current directory.
    - Paths can be absolute (starting from the root) or relative (based on the current location).
4. `**cd ..**`: Moves up one directory level (to the parent directory).
5. `**~**` **(Tilde)**: Represents your home directory.
    - Example: `**cd ~/Desktop**` navigates to the Desktop folder in your home directory.
6. **Tab Completion**: Press Tab for auto-completion of directory and file names.
7. **Efficiency Tips**:
    
    - Use `**cd ~**` for your home directory.
    - Utilize `**cd ..**` to move up in the directory tree.
    - Leverage tab completion to quickly select directories and files.
    
      
    

# **Creating Directories in PowerShell**

1. **GUI Method**: In the graphical user interface (GUI), you can create a new folder by right-clicking, selecting "New," and then choosing "Folder."
2. **CLI Method**: In PowerShell, you use the `**mkdir**` (short for "make directory") command to create a new directory.
3. **Basic Usage**: To create a new directory, use the command `**mkdir <directory_name>**`.
    - Example: `**mkdir my_cool_folder**`
4. **Handling Spaces**: If you want to include spaces in the directory name, you have a few options:
    - Surround the name with double quotes: `**mkdir "my cool folder"**`
    - Use the backtick (`) as an escape character: `**mkdir my**` cool `**folder**`

  

# **Creating Directories in Bash (Linux)**

1. **CLI Method**: In Bash (Linux), you use the `**mkdir**` (short for "make directory") command to create a new directory.
2. **Basic Usage**: To create a new directory, use the command `**mkdir <directory_name>**`.
    - Example: `**mkdir my_cool_folder**`
3. **Handling Spaces**: To create a directory with spaces in the name, you have two common options:
    - Use a backslash (`**\**`) as an escape character: `**mkdir my\ cool\ folder**`
    - Enclose the entire directory name in double quotes: `**mkdir "my cool folder"**`

  

**History in PowerShell:**

1. The `**history**` command in PowerShell allows you to view previously entered commands. The same is for Linux.
2. You can navigate through your command history using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard.
3. To reuse a previous command, simply navigate to it in the command history and press Enter.
4. Searching through command history: You can use the shortcut `**Ctrl-R**` to search through your command history. Type a keyword or partial command, and it will show matching entries. The same is for Linux

**Clearing the Screen in PowerShell:**

1. To clear the screen and make your shell interface cleaner, use the `**clear**` command.
2. The `**clear**` command removes previous command output from the screen but does not delete your command history. The same is for Linux.

  

  

# **Copying Files in PowerShell**

1. In PowerShell, you can use the `**Copy**` command (alias: `**cp**`) to copy files.
2. The basic syntax for copying a file is `**Copy-Item source destination**`, where `**source**` is the file you want to copy, and `**destination**` is the location where you want to copy it.
3. To copy a file, you can use the `**cp**` command followed by the file name and the destination path.
4. You can use wildcards, such as , to select multiple files based on a pattern, like `**.jpg**`.

**Copying Directories:**

1. To copy directories in PowerShell, use the `**Copy-Item**` command with the `**Recurse**` parameter.
2. The `**Recurse**` parameter is used to copy the contents of a directory along with the directory itself.
3. When copying directories, you should also specify the `**Verbose**` parameter to see detailed progress messages.
4. The basic syntax for copying a directory is `**Copy-Item -Recurse source destination**`, where `**source**` is the directory you want to copy, and `**destination**` is the location where you want to copy it.

By using the `**Copy**` and `**Copy-Item**` commands in PowerShell, you can easily copy files and directories to different locations in your file system.

The same is for Linux. The recurse flag for Linux is -r and verbose is -v

  

  

# **Renaming Files in Windows**

1. In PowerShell, you can use the `**Move-Item**` command (alias: `**mv**`) to rename files.
2. The basic syntax for renaming a file is `**Move-Item -Path oldName -Destination newName**`, where `**oldName**` is the current name of the file, and `**newName**` is the desired new name.
3. To rename a file, use the `**Move-Item**` command followed by the current file name and the desired new name.
4. You can rename a file without changing its directory by specifying the same directory in the `**Destination**` parameter.

**Moving Files:**

1. The `**Move-Item**` command can also be used to move files from one directory to another.
2. To move a file to a different directory, specify the `**Destination**` parameter with the new directory path.
3. You can use wildcards, such as , to move multiple files based on a pattern.

**Renaming and Moving Directories:**

1. You can apply the same principles to rename and move directories using the `**Move-Item**` command.
2. When moving directories, specify the `**Recurse**` parameter to move the entire directory and its contents.

The exact same commands can be used for Linux.

  

  

# **Removing Files in PowerShell**

1. In PowerShell, you can use the `**Remove-Item**` command (alias: `**rm**`) to delete files.
2. The basic syntax for removing a file is `**Remove-Item -Path fileName**`, where `**fileName**` is the name of the file you want to delete.
3. Be cautious when using `**Remove-Item**`, as it permanently deletes files without sending them to the recycle bin.
4. If you encounter permission issues or try to remove system files, you may need administrator privileges or the `**Force**` parameter to force removal.

**Removing Directories:**

1. The `**Remove-Item**` command can also be used to delete directories.
2. When removing a directory, PowerShell will prompt you to confirm the removal unless you use the `**Recurse**` parameter.
3. To remove a directory and its contents, use `**Remove-Item -Path directoryName -Recurse**`.
4. As with files, be cautious when removing directories, as they are permanently deleted.

**Permissions:**

1. File and directory removal may be restricted by permissions. If you lack permission to delete a file or directory, you'll need appropriate access rights or administrative privileges to proceed.

The same is for Linux.

  

  

  

**Viewing File Contents:**

1. In PowerShell, you can use the `**cat**` command (alias for `**Get-Content**`) to display the contents of a file.
2. To view a file's contents, use `**cat fileName**` where `**fileName**` is the name of the file you want to display.
3. By default, `**cat**` will display the entire file in the shell.

**Viewing File Contents Page by Page:**

1. To view a file one page at a time, you can use the `**more**` command. It pauses after filling the terminal window.
2. Navigate through the content using these keys:
    - Enter: Advance one line.
    - Space: Advance one page (depends on terminal window size).
    - Q: Quit the `**more**` command and return to the shell.

**Viewing the Head (Beginning) of a File:**

1. To view the beginning (head) of a file, you can combine `**cat**` with the `**Head**` parameter.
2. Use `**cat -Head 10 fileName**` to display the first 10 lines of a file.

**Viewing the Tail (End) of a File:**

1. To view the end (tail) of a file, you can combine `**cat**` with the `**Tail**` parameter.
2. Use `**cat -Tail 10 fileName**` to display the last 10 lines of a file.

  

**Viewing File Contents in Linux**

1. In Bash, you can use the `**cat**` command to display the contents of a file. For example, `**cat fileName**` will display the entire file.

**Viewing File Contents Page by Page:**

1. To view a file one page at a time and navigate interactively, you can use the `**less**` command. It's similar to the `**more**` command in Windows but offers more functionality.
2. While using `**less**`, you can navigate with:
    - Up and down arrow keys.
    - Page Up and Page Down keys.
    - Pressing `**G**` to move to the beginning of the file.
    - Pressing `**Shift+G**` (capital G) to move to the end of the file.
    - Using `**/**` followed by a word to search for a specific word or phrase.
    - Pressing `**Q**` to quit `**less**` and return to the shell.

**Viewing the Head (Beginning) of a File:**

1. To view the beginning (head) of a file in Linux, you can use the `**head**` command. By default, it shows the first ten lines of the file.

**Viewing the Tail (End) of a File:**

1. To view the end (tail) of a file in Linux, you can use the `**tail**` command. By default, it shows the last ten lines of the file.

# Searching Within Files

- Text editors typically use Ctrl-F to find words in a document.
- Windows has a Windows Search Service to index and search for files, but it doesn't search inside files by default.
- You can configure Windows Search Service to search file contents by changing settings in the Control Panel.
- Notepad++ is an alternative for searching within files using **Ctrl+Shift+F**.
- In PowerShell, you can use the "Select-String" (sls) command to search for words or patterns in files.
- The Select-String command provides file and line number information for matches.

List of Commands and Functions:

1. Ctrl-F: Find words in a document (common text editor command).
2. Windows Search Service: Indexes and searches for files on Windows.
3. Configure Windows Search Service:
    - Open Start menu.
    - Type "indexing."
    - Click on "Indexing Options."
    - Select the user folder.
    - Click "Advanced."
    - Go to the "File Types" tab and select "Index Properties and File Contents."
    - Close indexing options to rebuild the index.
4. Notepad++: Text editor with a search feature (Ctrl+Shift+F).
5. PowerShell:
    - "Select-String" (sls) command: Searches for words or patterns in files.
    - Example: `**Select-String -Path C:\Users\YourUser\* -Pattern "cow"**` to search for "cow" in files.
    - Wildcard character (*) can be used for pattern matching.

  

# Searching within Directories

- To search for specific files within a directory in PowerShell, you can use the "-Filter" parameter with the "ls" (or "Get-ChildItem") command.
- The "-Filter" parameter allows you to specify a pattern for file names.
- The pattern typically consists of an asterisk (*) to match anything and a file extension (e.g., .exe) to filter specific file types.

Example:

- To find all executable files (files ending in .exe) within a directory, you can use the following command:
    
    ```Shell
    
    ls -Recurse -Filter *.exe
    ```
    
      
    

  

# Searching within Files in Linux

- In Bash, you can use the "grep" command to search for words within files or check if a certain file exists in a directory.
- To search for a word within a file, use "grep" followed by the word and the file's name (e.g., `**grep cow farm_animals.txt**`).
- To search through multiple files with a pattern, use the asterisk (*) wildcard character along with "grep" (e.g., `**grep cow ***`).
- "grep" is a versatile tool for pattern matching and searching in text files.

  

  

  

  

1. In PowerShell, you can use various commands, I/O streams, and redirection operators to perform complex tasks.
2. Echo is an alias for Write-Output in PowerShell, which prints input to the screen.
3. PowerShell processes have three I/O streams: standard in, standard out, and standard error.
4. The ">" operator redirects standard output to a file, either overwriting an existing file or creating a new one.
5. The ">>" operator appends standard output to a file.
6. The pipe operator ("|") allows you to pass the output of one command as input to another.
7. You can combine commands and output redirection to perform complex tasks, such as filtering and saving specific data.
8. To redirect standard error, you use "2>" followed by the desired output location or "$null" to filter out error messages.
