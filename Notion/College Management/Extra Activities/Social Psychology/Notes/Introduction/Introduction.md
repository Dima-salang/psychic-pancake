> [!important] Social Psychology is the scientific study of how people’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by other people.

  

# Basic Principles of Social Behavior

1. Social behavior is goal oriented. People have short-term immediate goals that are linked to broader long-term goals and ultimately to more fundamental motives.
2. Social behavior represents a continual interaction between the person and the situation.

  

  

# The Person and the Situtation

  

> [!important] Motivation is the driving force, the energy, that moves people toward their desired outcomes.

  

> [!important] Goals are desired outcomes; something one whishes to achieve or accomplish.

> [!important] Motives are high-level goals fundamental to social survival

  

**Socialization** is the process whereby a culture teaches its members about its beliefs, customs, habits, and language. Each person has unique life experiences, making his or her set of goals somewhat **idiosyncratic**. We can observe that citizens within the same cultures usually have the same goals.

  

  

> [!important] Individualistic Orientation - the tendency to think of oneself as an individual and to give priority to one’s personal goals. Example is in the US.

> [!important] Collectivistic Orientation - the tendency to think of oneself as a member of the larger group and to place the group’s goals before one’s own. Example are Asian countries.

  

  

### Self-Regulation

- The process through which people select, monitor, and adjust their strategies in an attempt to achieve their goals.

### Attention

- Self-regulation sometimes requires considerable attention — people must contemplate alternative strategies, decide which ones to pursue, closely monitor their effectiveness, and thn adjust them if necessary.
- It is the process through which people consciously focus on what is going on within and around them.
    - We can think of it as a beam illuminating the information we need to accomplish our goals. When we are interested in romance, we shine our attentional beam on the appealing classmate and their reaction to us; when we are concerned about safety, we focus our attention instead on strangers and fast-moving cars.

  

### Automaticity

- refers to the ability of a behavior or cognitive process to operate without conscious guidance once it’s put into motion.
- By automatizing one task, we can devote our limited attention to other tasks. Basically, we can think of heuristics or mental shortcuts in which cognitive biases may arise.

  

  

### Social Dysfunction

- In the extreme, our inability to control unwanted thoughts may contribute to pathological obsessions
- When cognitive capacity is stressed, people may do the opposite of what they intend—especially if they are trying not to do something.
- Why do we sometimes do the opposite of what we intend? Wegner and Erber argue that we need to engage in two processes in order to move toward a goal:
    1. Put a plan in motion
    2. Monitor the plan for evidence that it may be failing.
- Unfortunately, it requires more cognitive effort to execute a plan than to monitor it. As a result, when cognitive capacity is overloaded—through time pressure, stress, or the existence of simultaneous concerns—executing a plan becomes increasingly difficult but detecting its failure does not.

  

We need to minimize stress and distraction, which consume cognitive resources. Don’t always work so hard to control those things that particularly haunt you. Also, practice your goal-seeking processes.

  

  

### Readying Motives and Goals for Action

- How do we determine the most pressing goal?
- THe impact of any motive or goal depends on its readiness. Goals gain priority when primed by relevant situations and compatible goals, and lose priority with the passage of time and with the activation of incompatible goals.
- Some goals are chronically ready, due to their frequent use or survival value.

  

  

# The Representational System

> [!important] Self-concept - a mental representation caputuring our views and beliefs about ourselves.

### The Nature of Mental Representations

- We call a representation of a specific episode, event, or individual an exemplar. Example: Martin Luther King Jr.
- A mental representation capturing the general characteristics of a particular class of episodes, events, or individuals are called a schema. Example: weddings, baby showers
- Schemas that represent the sequence of actions expected to occur within a particular situation or event. Example: dating

  

### Representing Ourselves

- we also have a representation of ourselves—the **self-concept, or self-schema**.
- Our self-view includes multiple selves. Some of our selves are linked to the role we play. Other selves are linked to the future—they represent what w eideally hope to become, what we think we ought to become, and what we fear becoming. Future selves like these are important as they help define our goals and direct our actions.
- Most of us possess, to some degree, a group or collective self such as being a FIlipino.

  

  

### Sources of Self-Concept

- One way we come to understand others is by observing their behaviors and inferring what those behaviors mean about the person.
