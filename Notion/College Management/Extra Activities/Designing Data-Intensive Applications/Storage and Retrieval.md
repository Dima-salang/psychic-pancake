  

On the most fundamental level, a db needs to do two things:

- when you give some data, it should store it
- when you ask it again later, it should give the data back to you.

  

  

# Data Structures that Power Your DB

  

Many databases internally use a log, an append-only data file.

In order to efficiently find the value for a particular key in the database, we need indexes. The general idea is to keep some additional metadata on the side, which acts as a signpost and helps you to locate the data.

  

An index is an additional structure that is derived from the primary data. maintaining additional structure is overhead, especially on writes. any kind of index usually slows down writes, because the index also needs to be updated every time data is written.

- well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down writes. this is why databases don‚Äôt index everything and usually require you to choose them.

  

# Hash Indexes

K

### **In-Depth Explanation of Hash Indexes in Databases**

A **hash index** is a type of index in databases that allows for efficient key-value lookups using a hash table. It is commonly used in key-value stores and log-structured databases because it enables fast direct access to values associated with specific keys.

---

## **1. The Basics of Hash Indexes**

A **hash index** maps keys to byte offsets in a data file stored on disk. This allows for efficient retrieval of values by performing the following steps:

1. Compute a **hash** of the key.
2. Use the hash to locate an **entry in an in-memory hash table**.
3. The hash table stores a **pointer (byte offset) to the data file** where the actual value is stored.
4. Seek to that location in the file and read the value.

This approach is simple and highly optimized for key-based lookups.

### **Example of How It Works**

Imagine a key-value store where each entry is appended to a log file:

```Plain
1, {"name": "London", "attractions": ["Big Ben", "London Eye"]}
42, {"name": "San Francisco", "attractions": ["Golden Gate Bridge"]}
```

An **in-memory hash table** maintains mappings like this:

```Plain
Key    ‚Üí Byte Offset
1      ‚Üí 0
42     ‚Üí 64
```

When a query requests key **42**, the database:

- Looks up key **42** in the hash table ‚Üí finds byte offset **64**.
- Seeks to **byte 64** in the log file.
- Reads and returns the value `{ "name": "San Francisco", "attractions": ["Golden Gate Bridge"] }`.

---

## **2. Advantages of Hash Indexes**

### ‚úÖ **Fast Lookup Times**

- Hash tables provide **O(1)** average-time complexity for lookups.
- Instead of scanning the entire file, the hash table provides a direct pointer to the data.

### ‚úÖ **Efficient for Workloads with Frequent Key Updates**

- If the same key is updated often (e.g., tracking video play counts), the latest value is appended to the log, and the hash table updates to point to the new position.
- Old values become irrelevant and can be garbage collected.

### ‚úÖ **Append-Only Writes**

- Instead of modifying data in place, new key-value pairs are **appended** to the log file.
- This results in **sequential writes**, which are much faster than random writes, especially on HDDs and SSDs.

### ‚úÖ **Crash Recovery is Manageable**

- If a crash occurs, the hash table can be **rebuilt** by scanning the log file.
- Alternatively, **periodic snapshots** of the hash table can be stored to speed up recovery.

---

## **3. Challenges of Hash Indexes**

### ‚ùå **Memory Usage**

- The **entire hash index must fit in RAM** because it maps every key to a file offset.
- If the number of keys grows too large, the system may **run out of memory**.

### ‚ùå **Not Efficient for Range Queries**

- Hash indexes work well for **exact lookups** but poorly for **range queries**.
- Example: If you want all keys between `kitty00000` and `kitty99999`, you must look up each key separately, which is inefficient.

### ‚ùå **Handling Deletes (Tombstones)**

- To delete a key, you **cannot modify the log file in place**.
- Instead, a **special deletion record (tombstone)** is written to the log.
- When logs are compacted, tombstones help remove stale entries.

### ‚ùå **Log Compaction and Merging Overhead**

- As new values for keys are appended, **old values remain in the log**.
- Periodically, **log compaction** must remove outdated values, merging log segments to free up space.

---

## **4. Compaction and Segment Merging**

Since we are continuously appending new key-value pairs, logs grow indefinitely. To prevent excessive disk space usage, **compaction** is used:

1. **Identify obsolete entries** (keys that have been updated multiple times).
2. **Retain only the latest values**.
3. **Merge multiple log segments** into a new, optimized segment.

### **Example of Log Compaction**

Initial log file (before compaction):

```Plain
mew: 1078
purr: 2103
purr: 2104
mew: 1079
mew: 1080
mew: 1082
```

After compaction (only latest values retained):

```Plain
mew: 1082
purr: 2104
```

By compacting the log, **disk space is freed**, and **query efficiency improves**.

---

## **5. Optimizations for Hash Indexes**

### üõ† **Snapshotting for Faster Recovery**

- Instead of rebuilding the hash table from the log after a crash, **periodic snapshots** of the hash table are stored.
- When the system restarts, the most recent snapshot is loaded into memory.

### üõ† **Checksum Validation for Corruption Detection**

- Each entry in the log is stored with a **checksum** to detect incomplete writes.
- If a write is interrupted (e.g., power failure), the system detects the corruption and discards the faulty entry.

### üõ† **Concurrency Control**

- Since log writes are **append-only**, they are handled by a **single writer thread**.
- Reads can be served **concurrently** from multiple threads since segments are immutable.

---

## **6. Real-World Use Cases**

### ‚úÖ **Bitcask (Riak‚Äôs Storage Engine)**

- Used in **Riak**, a distributed key-value store.
- Provides **high write throughput** and **fast lookups**.
- Requires that **all keys fit in memory**, making it suitable for use cases with a **high write rate per key but a manageable number of unique keys**.

### ‚úÖ **Caching Systems (Redis, Memcached)**

- Many caching systems use **hash-based indexes** for quick lookups.
- Since **data expires quickly**, compaction isn‚Äôt always necessary.

### ‚úÖ **Write-Heavy Applications**

- Systems that require **frequent updates to keys** (e.g., counters, logs, analytics).
- Example: **Video play counters** in a streaming service.

---

## **7. Alternative Indexing Approaches**

While hash indexes are great for **fast lookups**, other index types exist for different needs:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Index Type**|**Best For**|**Limitations**|
|**Hash Index**|Fast key lookups|No range queries, high memory usage|
|**B-Tree Index**|Range queries, ordered data|Slower than hash index for exact lookups|
|**LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)**|Write-heavy workloads|High read latency|
|**Bitmap Index**|Boolean queries (e.g., filtering users by gender)|Not ideal for high-cardinality data|

For applications that require **range queries**, a **B-Tree** or **LSM-Tree** (like in LevelDB or RocksDB) may be more suitable.

---

## **Conclusion**

Hash indexes are a powerful data structure for **fast key-value lookups**, but they come with trade-offs:

- **Ideal for write-heavy workloads** where frequent updates to the same keys occur.
- **Great for workloads where all keys fit in RAM**.
- **Not suitable for range queries** or very large datasets where in-memory indexing is impractical.

For real-world systems, **hybrid approaches** are often used:

- **Hash indexes for fast lookups**.
- **B-Trees or LSM-Trees for range queries**.
- **Secondary indexes** to optimize complex queries.

Would you like a comparison between hash indexes and **LSM-Trees** (used in databases like LevelDB and RocksDB)? üöÄ

  

  

Yes, **a segment file is different from the log**, though they are related. Let‚Äôs break down the distinction clearly.

---

### **1. The Log (Write-Ahead Log - WAL)**

- The log is an **append-only file** where **every write operation is recorded immediately** before being applied to memory.
- It is used **only for durability and crash recovery**.
- The log does **not** store data in a sorted way.
- If the database crashes, the log can be replayed to **reconstruct the latest state**.

### **Example of a Log**

Imagine we insert these key-value pairs:

```Plain
PUT ("apple", 10)
PUT ("banana", 20)
PUT ("cherry", 30)
```

These operations are **immediately appended** to the log:

```Plain
LOG:
apple ‚Üí 10
banana ‚Üí 20
cherry ‚Üí 30
```

This ensures that if a crash occurs before data is written to disk, the database can **recover by replaying the log**.

---

### **2. The Segment File (Immutable SSTable)**

- A **segment file is a structured, sorted file** that contains **actual stored data**.
- It is created by **flushing data from memory** (memtable) to disk.
- Unlike the log, segment files are **sorted by key** for fast lookups.
- Once written, **segment files are immutable**‚Äînew data goes into new segment files.
- Periodically, segment files are **merged and compacted** to remove old data.

### **Example of a Segment File**

Once the memtable is full, its data is **flushed** to a segment file:

```Plain
SEGMENT FILE 1:
apple ‚Üí 10
banana ‚Üí 20
cherry ‚Üí 30  (sorted)
```

Later, if we update "banana" and insert "date":

```Plain
PUT ("banana", 25)
PUT ("date", 40)
```

These will be written to a **new segment file**:

```Plain
SEGMENT FILE 2:
banana ‚Üí 25
date ‚Üí 40
```

Now, our database has **two segment files**, and a read request for "banana" will check the **latest segment first**.

---

### **Key Differences Between the Log and Segment File**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**Log (WAL)**|**Segment File (SSTable)**|
|**Purpose**|Ensures durability & crash recovery|Stores key-value data efficiently|
|**Order**|Unordered, append-only|Sorted by key for fast lookup|
|**Immutability**|Grows indefinitely (until flushed)|Immutable once written|
|**Usage**|Only for recovery|Used for reading and merging|
|**Storage Format**|Raw, unsorted operations|Structured, indexed SSTable|

---

### **Why Do We Need Both?**

- The **log** ensures we **never lose writes** in case of a crash.
- The **segment file** makes reads and range queries **efficient** by keeping data **sorted**.
- After flushing the memtable to a segment file, we can **delete the old log**, reducing unnecessary disk usage.

Thus, **logs are temporary, while segment files are the long-term storage format**.

# B-Trees

  

### **B-Trees: The Backbone of Many Databases**

B-Trees (Balanced Trees) are a type of **self-balancing search tree** widely used in databases and file systems for efficient indexing and searching. They optimize reads and writes on **disk-based storage**, making them ideal for large datasets.

---

## **1. Why Do We Need B-Trees?**

- **Binary search trees (BSTs)** can become **unbalanced**, leading to slow lookups.
- **Hash tables** are fast for key-value lookups but do **not support range queries**.
- **Log-structured storage (LSM-Trees)** are great for writes but require merging SSTables for fast reads.

üëâ **B-Trees provide a balance** between fast lookups, ordered storage, and efficient range queries while minimizing disk I/O.

---

## **2. Structure of a B-Tree**

A **B-Tree of order mm** follows these rules:

1. **Each node can have up to mm children**.
2. **Each node contains at most m‚àí1m-1 keys**, stored in **sorted order**.
3. **A node must have at least ‚åàm/2‚åâ‚àí1\lceil m/2 \rceil - 1 keys**, ensuring balance.
4. **All leaves are at the same level**, keeping access times consistent.

### **Example B-Tree (Order 4)**

A B-Tree of **order 4** means:

- **Each node can have up to 3 keys**.
- **Each internal node can have up to 4 children**.

```Plain
         [30]
       /       \
  [10, 20]   [40, 50, 60]
```

- Searching for **50**? Start at **30**, move right, and find it.
- Searching for **25**? Start at **30**, move left, then look between **20 and 30**.

---

## **3. Operations in B-Trees**

### **üîç Searching**

- Start from the root.
- Compare the key with node keys.
- If found, return the value.
- If not, move to the correct child.
- **Time Complexity: O(log‚Å°n)O(\log n) (because tree height is small)**.

---

### **üìù Insertion**

1. Insert the key in a leaf node (keeping keys sorted).
2. If the node **overflows** (more than m‚àí1m-1 keys), **split it**:
    - Move the middle key up.
    - Split the node into two.

‚úÖ This keeps the tree **balanced**.

**Example: Inserting 35 into our B-Tree**  
Before:  

```Plain
         [30]
       /       \
  [10, 20]   [40, 50, 60]
```

Insert **35** into the right child:

```Plain
         [30]
       /       \
  [10, 20]   [35, 40, 50, 60]
```

Now, **[35, 40, 50, 60]** exceeds 3 keys, so we **split it**:

```Plain
         [30, 40]
       /    |    \
  [10, 20] [35] [50, 60]
```

---

### **üóëÔ∏è Deletion**

1. Remove the key.
2. If it causes **underflow** (fewer than ‚åàm/2‚åâ‚àí1\lceil m/2 \rceil - 1 keys), merge with siblings.

Example: Deleting **30**:

```Plain
         [40]
       /    \
  [10, 20, 35] [50, 60]
```

---

## **4. B-Trees vs. LSM-Trees**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**B-Trees**|**LSM-Trees**|
|**Best For**|Fast reads|Fast writes|
|**Structure**|Multi-level tree|Cascading SSTables|
|**Writes**|Slower (directly updates disk)|Faster (writes in-memory first)|
|**Reads**|Faster (single lookup)|Slower (multiple SSTable lookups)|
|**Range Queries**|Efficient|Efficient|
|**Disk I/O**|Optimized for **few large reads/writes**|Optimized for **sequential writes**|

---

## **5. Where Are B-Trees Used?**

- **Relational Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL) ‚Üí **Indexes are stored as B-Trees**.
- **File Systems** (NTFS, HFS+) ‚Üí **Directory structures use B-Trees**.
- **Key-Value Stores** (Berkeley DB) ‚Üí Uses **B+ Trees**, a variation of B-Trees.

Would you like a deep dive into **B+ Trees**, which are even more optimized for databases? üöÄ

  

  

### **B+ Trees: A Database-Friendly Extension of B-Trees**

B+ Trees are an optimized version of **B-Trees**, designed to improve **disk-based storage and database indexing**. They are used in almost every modern database system, including **MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB**, for efficient searching and range queries.

---

## **1. Why B+ Trees?**

B-Trees work well, but they have **limitations** when handling large datasets stored on disk:

- **In B-Trees**, keys and values are stored **in every node**, leading to inefficient disk reads.
- **Searching requires traversing multiple levels**, causing **random disk accesses**, which are slow.
- **Range queries are inefficient** because you must traverse multiple nodes.

üëâ **B+ Trees solve these problems** by:

1. **Storing values only in leaf nodes** (internal nodes store keys for navigation).
2. **Linking all leaf nodes in a doubly linked list** for fast range queries.
3. **Ensuring all leaf nodes are at the same depth**, making searches predictable.

---

## **2. Structure of a B+ Tree**

A **B+ Tree of order mm** follows these rules:

1. **Internal nodes only store keys** (not values).
2. **Leaf nodes store both keys and values**, and they are **linked together**.
3. **Each internal node must have at most mm children**.
4. **Each internal node must have at least ‚åàm/2‚åâ\lceil m/2 \rceil children**.
5. **All leaf nodes are at the same depth**.

### **Example: A B+ Tree (Order 4)**

### **B-Tree Example**

```Plain
          [30]
         /    \
   [10, 20]   [40, 50, 60]  (keys + values in internal nodes)
```

**B+ Tree Version**

```Plain
          [30, 40]
         /       \
   [10, 20]     [30, 40, 50, 60]  (only keys in internal nodes)
         |       |
   (10) (20)  (30) (40) (50) (60)   (values only in leaf nodes, linked)
```

üöÄ **Advantages of B+ Trees**:

- **Faster range queries** ‚Üí Since leaf nodes are linked, scanning is sequential.
- **More keys per internal node** ‚Üí Fewer disk accesses.
- **Predictable access time** ‚Üí All leaf nodes are at the same level.

---

## **3. How Do B+ Trees Work in Databases?**

### **üîç Searching in a B+ Tree**

1. Start at the root.
2. Move down through **internal nodes** (comparing keys).
3. Reach the **leaf node**, where the actual values are stored.
4. Return the value.

‚úÖ **Time Complexity: O(log‚Å°n)O(\log n)** (same as B-Trees), but **faster in practice** due to fewer disk reads.

---

### **üìù Inserting into a B+ Tree**

1. Insert the key **into the correct leaf node**.
2. If the leaf node overflows (more than m‚àí1m-1 keys), **split it**:
    - Move the **middle key up** to the parent.
    - Create a new leaf node.

Example: Inserting **35** into our tree:

```Plain
          [30, 40]
         /       \
   [10, 20]     [30, 35, 40, 50, 60]
         |       |
   (10) (20)  (30) (35) (40) (50) (60)
```

After **splitting the leaf node**:

```Plain
          [30, 35, 40]
         /    |      \
   [10, 20] [30, 35] [40, 50, 60]
         |      |       |
   (10) (20) (30) (35) (40) (50) (60)
```

---

### **üóëÔ∏è Deleting from a B+ Tree**

1. Remove the key from the **leaf node**.
2. If the node underflows (fewer than ‚åàm/2‚åâ‚àí1\lceil m/2 \rceil - 1 keys):
    - **Borrow a key from a sibling**.
    - If borrowing isn't possible, **merge with a sibling**.

---

## **4. Why Are B+ Trees Used in Databases?**

B+ Trees are **ideal for databases** because they optimize **disk-based storage**.

### **üî• Key Advantages for Databases**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|B-Trees|**B+ Trees (Used in Databases)**|
|**Key-Value Storage**|Keys and values in all nodes|Values only in leaf nodes|
|**Disk I/O**|More disk accesses (random)|Fewer disk accesses (sequential)|
|**Range Queries**|Slow (traverse multiple nodes)|Fast (linked leaf nodes)|
|**Search Performance**|Good|Better|
|**Storage Efficiency**|Less efficient|More keys per node (better disk utilization)|

### **üõ¢Ô∏è How Databases Use B+ Trees**

1. **Primary and Secondary Indexes**:
    - The **Primary Index** (e.g., **B+ Tree on a primary key**) enables fast lookups.
    - The **Secondary Index** (e.g., **B+ Tree on a non-primary field**) speeds up queries on non-key attributes.
2. **Efficient Joins and Sorting**:
    - Since B+ Trees keep keys **sorted**, they speed up **ORDER BY** and **JOIN** operations.
3. **Buffering for Large Datasets**:
    - **B+ Trees store more keys per node**, reducing disk reads.

üëâ **Real-World Example: MySQL's InnoDB**

- MySQL **stores tables as clustered B+ Trees**.
- The **primary key is the tree‚Äôs root**, and all rows are stored in **leaf nodes**.

---

## **5. B+ Trees vs. LSM-Trees in Databases**

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**B+ Trees (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**|**LSM-Trees (LevelDB, RocksDB, Cassandra)**|
|**Best For**|Fast reads|Fast writes|
|**Write Performance**|Moderate (writes in-place)|High (writes in-memory first)|
|**Read Performance**|High (direct lookup)|Slower (checks multiple SSTables)|
|**Range Queries**|Efficient|Efficient|
|**Disk Usage**|More stable|Compact but needs merging|

---

## **Final Thoughts**

B+ Trees are **essential** for database indexing because they:  
‚úÖ **Minimize disk I/O** (sequential reads).

‚úÖ **Support fast range queries**.

‚úÖ **Ensure predictable performance** (balanced structure).

‚úÖ **Scale well** for large datasets.

Would you like an **in-depth breakdown of MySQL‚Äôs B+ Tree index implementation**? üöÄ

  

  

Yes! **B-Trees (and B+ Trees) in databases use pages** to efficiently manage storage on disk. This is critical because databases work with **large datasets** that don't fit in memory, so they **read and write data in chunks (pages) instead of individual keys**.

---

## **üîπ How B-Trees Use Pages in Databases**

### **1. Pages as Disk Blocks**

- A **page** (or **disk block**) is the **smallest unit of I/O** in a database.
- Typically **4 KB, 8 KB, or 16 KB** in size (depends on the database system).
- The database **reads/writes entire pages**, not single records, because disk I/O is expensive.

### **2. B-Trees Store Nodes in Pages**

- **Each node in a B-Tree (or B+ Tree) is stored in a page**.
- **Each page stores multiple keys and pointers** to child nodes.
- The **root node, internal nodes, and leaf nodes are all stored in separate pages**.

### **3. Navigating the B-Tree Using Pages**

1. **Start at the root node (page 1 in memory).**
2. **Find the right child node using the key range and follow the pointer (page ID).**
3. **Load the child node into memory from disk (if not already in cache).**
4. **Repeat until you reach a leaf node.**
5. **Read the value from the leaf node's page and return the result.**

---

## **üîπ Example: B+ Tree with Pages**

### Assume a database with **8 KB pages** and a B+ Tree of **order 4** (max 4 children per node).

- **Each page stores multiple keys and child pointers**.
- **Leaf nodes store actual data**, while **internal nodes store only keys and page pointers**.

### **B+ Tree Stored in Pages**

```Plain
Page 1 (Root Node)
--------------------------
[ 30 | 60 ] ‚Üí Pointers to Page 2 & Page 3

Page 2 (Internal Node)
--------------------------
[ 10 | 20 ] ‚Üí Pointers to Page 4 & Page 5

Page 3 (Internal Node)
--------------------------
[ 40 | 50 ] ‚Üí Pointers to Page 6 & Page 7

Page 4 (Leaf Node)
--------------------------
(10, Value A) ‚Üí (20, Value B)

Page 5 (Leaf Node)
--------------------------
(30, Value C) ‚Üí (40, Value D)

Page 6 (Leaf Node)
--------------------------
(50, Value E) ‚Üí (60, Value F)
```

üîπ Each **page stores multiple keys** and links to **other pages using pointers**.

üîπ This ensures **efficient disk reads and writes**, reducing random disk access.

---

## **üîπ Why Use Pages Instead of Individual Keys?**

1. **Minimizes disk reads** ‚Üí Fetching entire pages reduces expensive disk I/O.
2. **Efficient memory usage** ‚Üí Databases cache pages in RAM (buffer pool) for fast lookups.
3. **Supports large datasets** ‚Üí A tree with **millions of keys fits in fewer pages**, reducing depth.
4. **Speeds up range queries** ‚Üí Leaf nodes are **linked together**, so scanning is fast.

---

## **üîπ Real-World Database Implementations**

- **MySQL (InnoDB)** ‚Üí Uses **B+ Trees with 16 KB pages** for indexes.
- **PostgreSQL (B-Tree Indexes)** ‚Üí Uses **8 KB pages**.
- **MongoDB (WiredTiger)** ‚Üí Uses **B-Trees with pages** for indexing.

---

## **üîπ Conclusion**

‚úÖ **B-Trees in databases use pages to optimize disk access.**

‚úÖ **Each node fits within a page, reducing depth and disk reads.**

‚úÖ **Databases use page caching to avoid unnecessary disk I/O.**

‚úÖ **This structure enables fast lookups, inserts, and range queries.**

Would you like to explore how **databases cache B-Tree pages in memory** (buffer pools)? üöÄ

  

  

Sure! Let's visualize a **B+ Tree storing key-value pairs**, where keys are **numbers** and values are **strings** (or any data type). The keys help us find the correct leaf node, which stores the actual value.

---

### **üîπ Example: B+ Tree Storing Key-Value Pairs**

### **B+ Tree with Order 3 (Each node holds up to 3 keys)**

üìå **Keys** = Student IDs (numeric)

üìå **Values** = Student Names (string)

```Plain
                [30 | 60]
              /         \
    [10 | 20]         [40 | 50 | 70]
    /       \               |
[5,10]  [15,20]     [35,40,45,50,55]
 ["A","B"] ["C","D"] ["E","F","G","H","I"]
```

Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Internal nodes** (`[30 | 60]`, `[10 | 20]`, `[40 | 50 | 70]`) store **only keys** and **pointers to child nodes**.
- **Leaf nodes** (`[5,10]`, `[15,20]`, `[35,40,45,50,55]`) store **key-value pairs**:
    - `5 ‚Üí "A"`
    - `10 ‚Üí "B"`
    - `15 ‚Üí "C"`
    - `40 ‚Üí "F"`
    - `50 ‚Üí "H"`

### **üîç Example Search: Key = 40**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Start at Root** `**[30 | 60]**`

- `40` is **between 30 and 60**, so go **right**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Move to** `**[40 | 50 | 70]**`

- `40` is **first key**, so follow the **pointer to the leaf**.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Leaf Node** `**[35,40,45,50,55]**`

- **Find 40 ‚Üí Value is** `**"F"**` ‚úÖ

### **üîπ What If Values Are Complex?**

- A **value can be anything**: a string (`"Alice"`), a JSON object (`{age: 21}`), or even a **disk pointer**.
- In **databases**, leaf nodes **store the actual records** or **pointers** to the records on disk.
- Example:
    - `40 ‚Üí {name: "Alice", age: 21, GPA: 3.8}`

---

### **üîπ Why Store Values in Leaf Nodes?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Smaller Internal Nodes** ‚Üí **More keys fit in memory**, speeding up searches.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Efficient Disk Access** ‚Üí **Only leaf nodes touch disk**, reducing read times.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fast Range Queries** ‚Üí Leaf nodes are **linked** for quick sequential scans.

---

### **üîπ Key Takeaways**

- **Internal nodes** = Sorted keys to guide searches.
- **Leaf nodes** = Contain all values (strings, objects, etc.).
- **Search is log(N) fast**, even for large datasets.

This structure makes **B+ Trees ideal for databases** like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and index-based storage engines like RocksDB! üöÄ

  

  

To also prevent crashes during writes, B trees also use logs to store writes and if the writes are fully applied, the logs are deleted.

  

  

### **How Do Primary Keys Fit into B+ Trees?**

In databases, **primary keys** uniquely identify each row in a table. **B+ Trees** are commonly used to store and index primary keys efficiently, making searches, insertions, and range queries very fast.

---

### **üîπ How Does a Primary Key Work in a B+ Tree?**

- **The primary key is used as the "key" in the B+ Tree.**
- **The value stored in the leaf node** is either:
    1. The **entire row (record)**, if the table is small.
    2. A **pointer to the row** stored elsewhere (heap file or disk page), which is common in large databases.

---

### **üîπ Example: Storing Primary Keys in a B+ Tree**

Let‚Äôs say we have a **Students table**:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Student ID (PK)|Name|Age|
|101|Alice|22|
|105|Bob|24|
|110|Charlie|20|
|115|David|23|
|120|Eve|21|

Now, let‚Äôs build a **B+ Tree for the Student ID (Primary Key):**

```Plain
              [105 | 115]    ‚Üê Internal Node (Only Keys)
             /        \
    [101]            [110 | 115 | 120]  ‚Üê Leaf Nodes (Keys + Pointers)
     |                  |
    (ptr1)            (ptr2)
```

- **Internal Nodes:** Store only keys (`105, 115`) to guide the search.
- **Leaf Nodes:** Store key-value pairs where:
    - **Key** = Primary Key (Student ID)
    - **Value** = **Pointer to the actual record in the table**

So, if we **search for Student ID = 110**, we:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ Start at the **root** (`105 | 115`), go right.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Reach the **leaf node** (`110 | 115 | 120`).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Find **110** and follow its **pointer** (`ptr2`) to retrieve the full record:

```JSON
{ "Student ID": 110, "Name": "Charlie", "Age": 20 }
```

---

### **üîπ Why Store Values as Pointers Instead of Full Records?**

1. **Saves space** in the B+ Tree, allowing more keys to fit in memory.
2. **Efficient updates** ‚Üí If a row‚Äôs non-PK fields change, the index doesn't need modifications.
3. **Speeds up range queries** ‚Üí Leaf nodes are linked, allowing fast sequential scans.

---

### **üîπ What Happens When We Insert a New Student?**

### **Insert Student ID = 107**

- The leaf `[101]` is too small, and `[110 | 115 | 120]` has space.
- The new leaf node becomes `[105 | 107 | 110]`.
- If splitting is required, the **internal node is updated**.

---

### **üîπ Primary Key Indexes in Databases**

- **Clustered Index (Used in MySQL InnoDB)**
    - The B+ Tree **stores actual table rows** in the leaf nodes.
    - There‚Äôs no need for pointers ‚Üí **Faster queries**.
- **Non-Clustered Index (Used in PostgreSQL, MySQL MyISAM)**
    - The B+ Tree stores **pointers** to table rows stored elsewhere.
    - More flexible, but **requires extra lookup** to fetch full rows.

---

### **üîπ Summary**

- **Primary keys are stored in a B+ Tree** to speed up lookups.
- **Internal nodes** guide searches, **leaf nodes** store primary keys + row pointers.
- **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexing** depends on database engine.
- **Efficient for range queries, insertions, and updates.**

### **In-Depth Lecture on In-Memory Databases (IMDBs)**

---

## **1. Introduction to In-Memory Databases**

An **in-memory database (IMDB)** is a type of database that primarily stores its data in the main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. Unlike traditional disk-based databases that rely on persistent storage and use caching techniques to speed up access, IMDBs are optimized for fast read and write operations by keeping everything in volatile memory.

IMDBs are widely used in applications requiring high-speed transactions, low-latency access, and real-time processing, such as:

- **High-frequency trading** (stock exchanges)
- **Real-time analytics** (streaming applications)
- **Caching layers** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
- **Session management** (web applications)
- **Gaming leaderboards and matchmaking**

---

## **2. Foundations of In-Memory Databases**

IMDBs rely on fundamental principles of computer architecture, memory management, and data structures. Some key foundations include:

### **2.1. Volatile vs. Non-Volatile Storage**

- **Volatile Memory (RAM):** IMDBs store data in RAM, which provides fast access but loses data if the system crashes or restarts.
- **Non-Volatile Storage (Disk or SSD):** Some IMDBs use disk-based persistence techniques like **periodic snapshots**, **write-ahead logging (WAL)**, or **replication** to recover data after a crash.

### **2.2. Data Structures for Fast Access**

IMDBs use optimized data structures to store and retrieve data efficiently:

- **Hash Tables** (O(1) lookup) ‚Äì Used for key-value stores like Redis.
- **B-Trees / B+ Trees** (O(log n) lookup) ‚Äì Used in relational IMDBs.
- **Skip Lists** ‚Äì Alternative to balanced trees, used in Redis Sorted Sets.
- **Trie Structures** ‚Äì Used for text indexing and prefix searches.
- **Row-based vs. Column-based Storage** ‚Äì Columnar IMDBs (like SAP HANA) optimize for analytical queries.

### **2.3. Multi-threading and Lock-Free Data Structures**

To avoid performance bottlenecks, IMDBs often use:

- **Lock-free algorithms** (reducing contention in multi-threaded environments)
- **Optimistic concurrency control (OCC)** (instead of locks)
- **Sharding** (distributing data across multiple memory regions)

---

## **3. How In-Memory Databases Work**

### **3.1. Data Storage Mechanism**

Instead of writing to disk, IMDBs maintain data structures entirely in RAM. However, they still provide **durability** through:

1. **Snapshots (Checkpointing):** Periodic dumps of memory data to disk.
2. **Append-Only Logs (AOF):** Logging every change and replaying it upon restart.
3. **Replication:** Keeping copies of data in different memory locations.

### **3.2. Query Execution**

- Traditional databases retrieve data from disk, causing **I/O overhead**.
- IMDBs execute queries directly in RAM, avoiding disk I/O and making queries much faster.

### **3.3. Persistence Strategies**

While IMDBs are optimized for speed, they still implement some persistence techniques:

- **Disk-Based Checkpointing:** Saving periodic copies of data to disk.
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):** Logging changes before applying them.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Some databases use both memory and disk for hybrid persistence.

### **3.4. Transactions and Consistency**

IMDBs can be **ACID-compliant** (like VoltDB) or follow an **eventual consistency** model (like Redis in asynchronous replication mode). To ensure data consistency, they use:

- **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** for concurrent transactions.
- **Lock-free or optimistic concurrency control** for high-speed writes.

---

## **4. Key Types of In-Memory Databases**

### **4.1. Key-Value Stores**

- Store data as key-value pairs (e.g., `{"user:123": "Alice"}`)
- Examples: **Redis, Memcached, Amazon ElastiCache**
- Use cases: Caching, real-time session management, distributed computing

### **4.2. Relational In-Memory Databases**

- Support **SQL-like queries** but store data in RAM instead of disk.
- Examples: **SAP HANA, VoltDB, Microsoft SQL Server In-Memory OLTP**
- Use cases: High-performance transaction processing, real-time analytics

### **4.3. NoSQL and Document Stores**

- Store JSON-like documents in memory for fast retrieval.
- Examples: **MongoDB (with in-memory storage engine), Aerospike**
- Use cases: Real-time applications, big data analytics

### **4.4. Hybrid Databases**

- Combine in-memory processing with persistent storage.
- Examples: **MySQL (MEMORY storage engine), Apache Ignite**
- Use cases: Applications needing both speed and durability

## **5. Advantages of In-Memory Databases**

### **5.1. Performance**

- **Zero disk I/O:** Eliminates slow disk reads/writes.
- **Low-latency access:** Access times in microseconds (vs. milliseconds for disk-based DBs).
- **High throughput:** Supports millions of transactions per second.

### **5.2. Scalability**

- **Horizontally scalable:** Can distribute data across multiple nodes.
- **Sharding:** Data can be split across multiple servers for load balancing.

### **5.3. Real-Time Processing**

- Used in analytics, IoT, and event-driven architectures where millisecond response time is needed.

---

## **6. Challenges of In-Memory Databases**

### **6.1. Data Loss in Case of Failure**

Since data is stored in volatile memory, power failures or crashes can lead to loss unless durability mechanisms (e.g., AOF, replication) are in place.

### **6.2. High Memory Costs**

RAM is more expensive than disk, making large-scale in-memory storage costly.

### **6.3. Limited Storage Capacity**

Unlike disk-based databases, the dataset size is limited by available RAM.

### **6.4. Persistence Trade-offs**

- Fully in-memory databases **sacrifice durability** for speed.
- Hybrid databases attempt to **balance performance and persistence**.

---

## **7. Step-by-Step Example of an In-Memory Database**

### **Scenario: Using Redis as an In-Memory Key-Value Store**

1. **Write Operation:**
    
    ```Plain
    SET user:1001 "Alice"
    ```
    
    - Stores `"Alice"` in RAM with key `"user:1001"`.
2. **Read Operation:**
    
    ```Plain
    GET user:1001
    ```
    
    - Returns `"Alice"` in **microseconds**.
3. **Persistence (if enabled):**
    - Redis can **persist data** using AOF or snapshots.

---

## **8. Future of In-Memory Databases**

- **Persistent Memory (PMEM):** New technologies like **Intel Optane** bridge the gap between RAM and SSDs.
- **AI and ML Integration:** IMDBs are being used for **real-time AI inference**.
- **Hybrid Systems:** Combining in-memory and disk-based storage for best performance.

---

## **9. Conclusion**

- In-memory databases **eliminate disk bottlenecks** and **boost performance**.
- They are **ideal for real-time applications** but come with **challenges** like data volatility and high costs.
- **Hybrid approaches** are becoming more common to balance speed and durability.
