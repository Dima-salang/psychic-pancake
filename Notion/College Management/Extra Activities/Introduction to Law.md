# Chapter 1: LAW, ITS CONCEPT AND CLASSIFICATION

  

## Definition of Law

- the term law in its broades sense, means any rule of action or norm of conduct applicable to all kinds of action and to all objects of creation. In this sense therefore, it includes all laws.
- In a strict legal sense, law is defined as a rule of conduct, just and obligatory, laid down by legitimate authority for common observance and benefit (Sanchez Roman, 23)
    - It is a rule of conduct
        - Laws serve as guides of an individual in relation to his fellowmen and to his community
    - Law must be just
    - It must be obligatory
        - if laws are not enforced, the purpose for which they are intended will not be served
    - Laws must be prescribed by legitimate authority
        - if laws are not prescribed by legitimate authority, the people could not be expected to observe them. Authority to make laws is conferred upon those duly chosen by the sovereign will of the people. This is in consonance with Section 1, Article II of the Philippine Constitution which says that “sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates from them”
    - Laws must be ordained for the common benefit
        - this recognizes the famous latin maxim: “Salus Populi Est Suprema Lex” — the welfare of the people shall be the supreme law.
        - Laws should be applied not only to a particular group. They are supposed to be applied equally to all citizens.

  

## Sources of Law

- Law is derived from different sources: legislation, precedent, custom, and court decision.
- Legislation
    - Before the declaration of Martial Law in the Philippines on September 21, 1972, the power to legislate laws is vested on the Congress of the Philippines which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
- Precedent
    - this means that the decisions or principles enunciated by a court of competent jurisdiction on a question of law do not only serve as guides but also as authority to be followed by all other courts of equal or inferior jurisdiction in all cases involving the same question until the same is overruled or reversed by a superior court
- Custom
    - Customs have the force of law only when they are acknowledged and approved by society through long and uninterrupted usage
        - In the Philippines, there are several requisites before the court considers custom
            - A custom must be proved as a fact according to the rule of evidence
            - The custom must not be contrary to law
            - Tere must be a number of repeated acts and these repeated acts must have been uniformly performed.
            - There must be a judicial intention to make a rule of social conduct
            - A custom must be acknowledged and approved by society through long and uninterrupted usage
- Court decision
    - judicial decisions which apply or interpret the Constitution and the laws. Although judicial decisions are not laws, they are evidence of the meaning and interpretation of the law.
    - In the Philippines, we adhere to the doctrine of STARE DECISIS which means that once a case has been decided one way, then another case involving exactly the same question or point of law should be decided in the same manner.

  

# Chapter II: WORLD’S LEGAL SYSTEMS

  

## The Three Prevailing Legal Systems

  

### Roman Law

- Roman law is the body of rules and principles adopted to guide the Romans in the conduct or observance of their personal and official affairs without necessarily specifying the period when those rules were promulgated.

  

### VALUE AND IMPORTANCE OF ROMAN LAW

- Our New Civil Code is basically Roman in origin.
- Ignorantia legis non excusat - Ignorance of the law excuses no one
- Dura lex sed lex - the law may be harsh, but it is still the law
- Cessante ration cessat ipsa lex - when the reason for the law ceases, the law also ceases to exist
- Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas - the owner of a thing cannot make use thereof in such a manner as to injure the rights of a third person
- Patria potesta - parental authority
- Negotiorum gestio - Unauthorized management
- Nulla poena sine lege - there is no crime when there is no law punishing it.
- Caveat emptor - buyers beware

  

### Common Law

- is derived from case law and books of authority.
- The defining characteristic of common law is that it arises as [precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent). Common law courts look to the past decisions of courts to synthesize the legal principles of past cases. _[Stare decisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stare_decisis)_, the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law\#cite_note-5) If a court finds that a similar dispute to the present one has been resolved in the past, the court is generally bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision.

  

### Mohammedian Law

- principally derived from the Korran and from writings of Islamic jurists.

  

  

# Chapter III: LAW AND ITS APPLICATIONS

  

## COURT’S DUTY TO DECIDE EVERY CASE

- a judge cannot decline or render judgment by reason of the silence, obscurity, or insufficiency of the laws.
- He must decide the case assigned to him whether or not he knows what law shall be applied. In case of silence, obscurity, or insufficiency of the laws, a judge may be guided:
    - Customs which are not contrary to law, public order, or public policy
    - Court decisions
    - Legal opinions of qualified writers and professors.
    - General principles of justice and equity
    - Rules of statutory construction
- In criminal cases, however, it is an established rule that there is no crime when there is no law punishing it — Nulla Poena Sine Lege. If there is no law, therefore, which punishes an act complained of , the judge must dismiss the case.

  

  

  

# Chapter VI - PERSONS

  

## Concept of a Person

- in Roman law, a person is one who is capable to exercise ownership and legal rights and to incur and contract obligations.
- The old and the new Constitutions of the Philippines, guarantee protection of the laws and this means that no person or class of person, whether rich or poor and regardless of his religious belief and political persuasion, shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes of persons in the same place and in like circumstances.
- Under the New Civil Code, a person may be a natural or a juridical person. A natural person refers to a human being and a juridical person refers to any of the following
    - The state and its political subdivision
    - Other corporations, institutions and entities for public interest or purposes, created by law
    - Corporations, partnerships, and associations for private interest or purpose to which the law grants a juridical personality, separate and distinct form that of each shareholder, partner, or member.

  

## Capacity

- Under the New Civil Code, a person has full or complete civil capacity if he has juridical capacity and capacity to act. Juridical capacity is the fitness to be the subject of legal relations. Capacity to act is the power to do acts with legal effects
    - “Juridical capacity, which is the fitness to be the subject of legal relation, is inherent in every natural person and is lost only through death. Capacity t act, which is the power to do acts with legal effect is acquired and may be lost. ”
    - Article 38 of the New Civil Code:
        - “Minority, insanity, imbecility, the state of being deaf-mute, prodigality, and civil interdiction are mere restrictions on capacity to act, and do not exempt the incapacitated person from certain obligations, as when the latter arise from his acts or from property relations, such as easement.”

  

  

## WHEN DOES THE PERSONALITY OF A NATURAL PERSON BEGIN

- personality of a natural person begins at conception (not at birth) provided that birth should occur later. This is based on Article 40 on the New Civil Code

  

## WHEN DOES THE PERSONALITY OF A PRIVATE CORPORATION (PRIVATE JURIDICAL PERSON) BEGIN?

- it begins from the moment a certificate of incorporation is granted to it by the Securities and Exchange Commission. From this moment, it has a personality separate and distinct from its stockholders.
