### 1. Theoretical Foundations of Symmetric Encryption

- **Core Concept**: Symmetric encryption ensures confidentiality by transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable form (ciphertext) using a single shared secret key, reversible only with that same key. It’s the cryptographic bedrock for hiding information, rooted in the principle that only keyholders can unlock the secret.
- **Formal Definition**: A symmetric encryption scheme is a pair of functions:
    - **Encryption**: \( E: K \times P \to C \), where \( K \) is the key space, \( P \) is the plaintext space, and \( C \) is the ciphertext space. For key \( k \in K \) and plaintext \( x \in P \), \( E(k, x) = y \), producing ciphertext \( y \in C \).
    - **Decryption**: \( D: K \times C \to P \), where \( D(k, y) = x \), recovering the original plaintext. The critical property is \( D(k, E(k, x)) = x \) for all \( k, x \).
- **Why Symmetric?**: The symmetry lies in the single key—unlike asymmetric encryption (later in the chapter), where keys split into public/private pairs. This simplicity drives efficiency but demands secure key sharing.

### Components (Figure 2.1)

- **Plaintext (P)**: The raw message—e.g., "ATTACK AT DAWN" or a binary file. Mathematically, a string over some alphabet (e.g., bits, bytes).
- **Encryption Algorithm (E)**: A deterministic function applying substitutions (replacing elements) and permutations (rearranging them), parameterized by the key. Think of it as a recipe with a secret twist.
- **Secret Key (K)**: A random string (e.g., 56 bits for DES) controlling the transformation. The key’s secrecy is the system’s linchpin—same key, same output; different key, gibberish.
- **Ciphertext (C)**: The scrambled result—unintelligible without the key (e.g., "XKQJWL ZQ FZND"). Must appear random to outsiders.
- **Decryption Algorithm (D)**: The inverse function, unwinding \( E \) with \( k \) to restore \( P \).
- **Analogy**: A locked diary. Plaintext is your entry, the algorithm is the lock’s mechanism, the key is your unique code, ciphertext is the locked-up scribbles, and decryption is unlocking it.

### Security Requirements

1. **Strong Algorithm**: The encryption must resist reverse-engineering. Formally, given \( E \) and \( y = E(k, x) \), deducing \( x \) or \( k \) should be computationally infeasible without \( k \). Even with plaintext-ciphertext pairs (\( x_i, y_i \)), the key must remain hidden—a property called **semantic security**.
2. **Key Secrecy**: The key must be shared securely (e.g., via trusted courier) and protected. If \( k \) leaks, all past and future messages using it are exposed—total collapse.

- **Theoretical Insight**: Security hinges on the **one-time pad** ideal—perfect secrecy if the key is as long as the message, truly random, and used once (Shannon, 1949). Symmetric ciphers approximate this with shorter, reusable keys, trading perfection for practicality.

### Attacks on Symmetric Encryption

- **Cryptanalysis**: Exploits algorithm weaknesses or plaintext patterns. Example: If \( E \) has a bias (e.g., certain outputs are more likely), attackers infer \( k \) or \( x \) via statistical analysis (differential cryptanalysis, linear cryptanalysis).
- **Brute-Force**: Tries all keys in \( K \). For key size \( n \) bits, there are \( 2^n \) keys, so the expected effort is \( 2^{n-1} \) tries. Success depends on recognizing plaintext (e.g., English text vs. compressed data).
- **Complexity**: Brute-force time is exponential in key length—\( O(2^n) \)—making larger keys exponentially harder to crack. Cryptanalysis aims for sub-exponential shortcuts, exploiting design flaws.

---

### 2. Symmetric Block Ciphers: Theoretical Design and Evolution

- **Definition**: A block cipher encrypts fixed-size chunks (blocks) of plaintext (e.g., 64 or 128 bits) into equal-sized ciphertext blocks, using a key to define the mapping. It’s a permutation over the block space, parameterized by \( k \).
- **Structure**: Built from **rounds**—iterated steps of substitution (confusion, obscuring data) and permutation (diffusion, spreading changes)—ensuring each bit affects the whole output (avalanche effect).
- **Why Blocks?**: Fixed sizes enable rigorous design, parallel processing, and standardized security analysis, unlike stream ciphers’ continuous flow.

### Data Encryption Standard (DES)

- **Specs**: 64-bit blocks, 56-bit key (8 parity bits make 64 total). Adopted 1977 by NIST as FIPS 46.
- **Mechanics**: 16 rounds of Feistel structure—a reversible design splitting the block into two halves, mixing them with key-derived subkeys via S-boxes (substitution) and P-boxes (permutation).
- **Theoretical Strength**:
    - **Key Space**: \( 2^{56} \approx 7.2 \times 10^{16} \) keys. Small by modern standards.
    - **Security Model**: Resists known plaintext attacks if no structural flaws exist. Feistel’s design ensures invertibility without key exposure.
- **Weaknesses**:
    - **Cryptanalysis**: No fatal flaw found—S-boxes designed to thwart linear attacks (NSA influence). Differential cryptanalysis (1990s) narrows effort but still impractical (\( 2^{47} \) operations).
    - **Key Length**: \( 2^{56} \) is brute-forceable. At \( 10^9 \) decryptions/sec (modern PC), it’s ~1 year; at \( 10^{13} \) (supercomputer), ~1 hour (Table 2.2).
- **Analogy**: A 56-number combination lock—sturdy mechanism, but too few combos for today’s lockpicks.

### Triple DES (3DES)

- **Specs**: 64-bit blocks, 112 or 168-bit keys (two or three 56-bit keys). Runs DES thrice: \( E_{k3}(D_{k2}(E_{k1}(P))) \).
- **Mechanics**: Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt (EDE) sequence with distinct keys enhances security while preserving DES compatibility (single key reverts to DES).
- **Theoretical Strength**:
    - **Key Space**: \( 2^{168} \approx 3.7 \times 10^{50} \) (three keys)—exponentially larger, brute-force infeasible (\( 5.8 \times 10^{29} \) years at \( 10^{13}/s \)).
    - **Cryptanalysis**: Inherits DES’s resistance; middle decrypt step complicates attacks but doesn’t weaken it fundamentally.
- **Drawbacks**:
    - **Performance**: Three DES runs—slow in software (1970s hardware focus).
    - **Block Size**: 64 bits limits security (birthday paradox: collisions at \( 2^{32} \) blocks) and efficiency.
- **Analogy**: Three locks on one door—super secure but slow to open, and the door’s still narrow.

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

- **Specs**: 128-bit blocks, 128/192/256-bit keys. NIST standard (FIPS 197, 2001) after Rijndael won a global contest.
- **Mechanics**: Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)—10/12/14 rounds (by key size) of byte substitution (S-box), row shifting, column mixing, and key addition. Non-Feistel, fully symmetric.
- **Theoretical Strength**:
    - **Key Space**: \( 2^{128} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{38} \), \( 2^{256} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{77} \)—unbreakable by brute-force (e.g., \( 5.3 \times 10^{17} \) years at \( 10^{13}/s \) for 128-bit).
    - **Cryptanalysis**: Designed against differential and linear attacks—wide trail strategy ensures diffusion. No practical break after 20+ years.
    - **Block Size**: 128 bits resists collisions, supports larger data securely.
- **Advantages**: Fast (hardware-optimized, e.g., Intel AES-NI), flexible, future-proof.
- **Analogy**: A massive, modern vault—big door (128-bit), endless combos (256-bit), quick to unlock with the right key.

### Modes of Operation

- **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**:
    - **Theory**: Each block encrypted independently: \( C_i = E(k, P_i) \). A permutation per block.
    - **Weakness**: Identical plaintext blocks yield identical ciphertext—leaks patterns (e.g., repeated headers). Insecure for large data (deterministic).
    - **Math**: No diffusion across blocks—breaks the avalanche effect beyond 128 bits.
- **Why Modes Matter**: ECB’s simplicity fails confidentiality for structured data. Advanced modes (e.g., CBC, CTR—Chapter 20) chain blocks or add randomness, approximating one-time pad security.

---

### 3. Stream Ciphers: A Continuous Alternative

- **Definition**: Encrypts data as a continuous stream (e.g., byte-by-byte), producing output in real-time vs. block ciphers’ batch approach.
- **Mechanics (Figure 2.2b)**:
    - **Keystream Generator**: A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) takes a key \( k \) and outputs a keystream \( k_1, k_2, \ldots \) (e.g., 8-bit chunks).
    - **Encryption**: \( C_i = P_i \oplus k_i \) (XOR)—bitwise addition modulo 2.
    - **Decryption**: \( P_i = C_i \oplus k_i \)—XOR’s self-inverse property (\( a \oplus a = 0 \)).
- **Theoretical Basis**:
    - **Security**: Relies on PRNG unpredictability—mimics a one-time pad if keystream is truly random and never reused. Weak PRNGs (e.g., linear feedback shift registers) collapse to cryptanalysis.
    - **Perfect Secrecy**: Achievable only with infinite, random keys (Shannon); stream ciphers use finite keys and PRNGs, trading off for practicality.
- **Advantages**:
    - **Speed**: No block buffering—ideal for real-time (e.g., network streams).
    - **Lightweight**: Less code, lower overhead vs. block ciphers’ rounds.
- **Drawbacks**: Key reuse is fatal (e.g., \( C_1 \oplus C_2 = P_1 \oplus P_2 \))—requires nonce/IV to avoid repetition.
- **Analogy**: Block cipher = sealing letters in boxes; stream cipher = scrambling a live phone call word-by-word.

### Block vs. Stream: Theoretical Trade-Offs

- **Block**: Reusable keys, structured security, but slower for streams. Suits files, databases (discrete units).
- **Stream**: Fast, continuous, but fragile if mismanaged (key reuse). Suits live data (e.g., VoIP, web browsing).
- **Math Insight**: Block ciphers permute a finite set (\( 2^{64} \) or \( 2^{128} \)); stream ciphers approximate an infinite, random sequence—different paradigms for the same goal.

---

### 4. Theoretical Insights and Implications

- **Confidentiality Model**: Symmetric encryption achieves **indistinguishability**—ciphertext reveals no plaintext info without \( k \). Formally, an adversary can’t distinguish \( E(k, P_0) \) from \( E(k, P_1) \) (IND-CPA security).
- **Key Length**: Governs security exponentially—\( n \)-bit key takes \( O(2^n) \) effort to brute-force, but cryptanalysis seeks \( o(2^n) \) shortcuts. AES’s 128+ bits outpace foreseeable computing (even quantum reduces to \( 2^{n/2} \), still huge).
- **Algorithm Design**: Must balance confusion (non-linearity, e.g., S-boxes) and diffusion (spread, e.g., permutations) to thwart attacks—Feistel (DES) vs. SPN (AES) showcase this evolution.
- **Practical Limits**: Key management is the bottleneck—secure exchange (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) and storage (e.g., hardware modules) are as critical as the algorithm.

---

### 5. Hands-On Theoretical Example

- **Scenario**: Encrypt "HELLO" (5 bytes) with a toy stream cipher.
    - **Key**: \( k = 1010 \) (4-bit seed).
    - **PRNG**: Simple LFSR—shift and XOR (not secure, illustrative): \( k_1 = 1010, k_2 = 0101, k_3 = 1011, \ldots \).
    - **Plaintext**: \( H=01001000, E=01000101, L=01001100, \ldots \).
    - **Ciphertext**: \( C_1 = 01001000 \oplus 1010 = 01000010, \ldots \) (XOR byte-wise with repeating keystream).
    - **Result**: Gibberish, reversible with \( k \).
- **Block Contrast**: DES would pad to 64 bits, encrypt as one block—less granular but pattern-resistant with modes.

---

### 6. Key Takeaways

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Single-key confidentiality—fast, elegant, key-dependent.
- **Block Ciphers**: DES (old, weak), 3DES (stronger, slow), AES (modern, robust)—evolution of security and scale.
- **Stream Ciphers**: Continuous, lightweight—trade reusability for speed.
- **Theory**: Security = key secrecy + algorithm strength; practicality tempers perfection.

# PRNGs

  

---

### 🔢 What is a PRNG?

A **pseudorandom number generator (PRNG)** is an algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers. But it's **deterministic**: given the same **initial seed**, it always generates the same sequence.

---

### 🧠 High-Level Idea

1. You give the PRNG a **seed** — just an initial number (e.g., 42).
2. The PRNG applies a **mathematical function** to that seed to produce a new number.
3. That number becomes the **new internal state**, and the process repeats.
4. The output values (or some transformation of them) are returned as "random" numbers.

So it's like:

```Plain
state_0 = seed
state_1 = f(state_0)
state_2 = f(state_1)
...
random_output = transform(state_n)
```

---

### 🛠️ A Classic Example: **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)**

This is one of the simplest PRNGs. The formula is:

```Plain
X_(n+1) = (a * X_n + c) mod m
```

Where:

- `X` is the sequence of pseudorandom numbers
- `a` is the multiplier
- `c` is the increment
- `m` is the modulus
- `X_0` is the seed

### 🔍 Example:

Let’s pick:

- `a = 1664525`
- `c = 1013904223`
- `m = 2^32`
- `X_0 = 42`

Now generate a few steps:

```Plain
X_1 = (1664525 * 42 + 1013904223) mod 2^32
X_2 = (1664525 * X_1 + 1013904223) mod 2^32
...
```

Each step deterministically follows the last. But if you _don’t_ know the seed or the parameters, the sequence can look random.

---

### 🤯 But Why Does This Look Random?

Even though it’s entirely deterministic:

- The math is non-trivial enough that the output doesn’t show obvious patterns.
- The full cycle length (how long before it repeats) can be very long.
- The outputs are uniformly distributed if the parameters are well chosen.

---

### ⚙️ More Sophisticated PRNGs

Modern PRNGs are more complex to increase randomness quality and cycle length:

- **Mersenne Twister (e.g., in Python’s** `**random**`**)**
    - Has a very long period: 219937−12^{19937} - 1
    - Uses bitwise operations and large internal state
- **Xorshift, PCG, and SplitMix**
    - Use combinations of shifts, XORs, and other bit manipulations

These still work by repeatedly updating an internal state using deterministic functions, just like LCGs, but they’re more resistant to patterns and statistical flaws.

---

### 🧪 Key Properties of a Good PRNG

- **Deterministic** (good for debugging)
- **Long period** before it repeats
- **Uniform distribution** of outputs
- **Statistical randomness** (passes randomness tests)
- **Speed** (especially important in games, simulations, etc.)

---

### 💡 Summary

PRNGs:

- Use a **seed** as a starting point
- Apply deterministic **mathematical functions** repeatedly
- Appear random, but are completely **predictable if you know the algorithm and seed**
- Are different from **true random number generators (TRNGs)** which rely on physical randomness (like radioactive decay or atmospheric noise)

---

If you're curious, I can walk you through code examples of a basic PRNG or how to write your own in Python or C. Would you like that?

  

> Given a seed, how does a PRNG generate something like a die roll (e.g., a value from 1 to 6)?

Great — let's break it down step by step.

---

### 🎲 Goal: Simulate a Fair 6-Sided Die

You want:

- A number from **1 to 6**
- That appears **random**
- Based only on a **seed**

---

### 🧮 Step 1: Seed initializes the PRNG

You start with a seed:

```Python
random.seed(42)
```

Under the hood:

- The PRNG initializes its **internal state** using that seed.
- That state is just a number (or an array of numbers in more advanced PRNGs).

---

### 🔁 Step 2: Generate a "raw" pseudorandom number

The PRNG will now produce a **raw number**, usually a big integer or float:

```Python
raw = random.random()  # Example: 0.6394267984578837
```

Internally, this number came from applying some function `f(state)` (like in Mersenne Twister or LCG).

---

### 🎯 Step 3: Map the raw number to the die range

This step is simple but crucial. You want to map your value (say in `[0.0, 1.0)`) to the die's value range `[1, 6]`.

There are two common ways to do this:

### Option 1: Using `random.randint(1, 6)`:

```Python
value = int(random.random() * 6) + 1
```

Here's what happens:

- `random.random()` gives you a float in [0.0, 1.0)
- Multiply by 6 → now in [0.0, 6.0)
- Convert to `int` (floor it) → now in [0, 5]
- Add 1 → now in [1, 6] ✅

So for example:

```Python
r = 0.6394267984578837
int(r * 6) + 1 = int(3.836560790747302) + 1 = 4
```

Die roll result: **4**

---

### 💡 Summary

Here's the full chain:

```Plain
seed → PRNG state → raw float (0.0–1.0) → scaled to [1–6] → die roll
```

It’s deterministic! If you use the same seed, you’ll get the same “random” die rolls every time.

---

### ✨ Visualization

Let’s say we want to simulate 3 rolls using a seed:

```Python
import random

random.seed(42)
for _ in range(3):
    print(int(random.random() * 6) + 1)
```

Output:

```Plain
4
1
1
```

Use the same seed, and you'll always get that same roll sequence.

---

### 🔒 Bonus: Why is this safe-ish for simulation but not for cryptography?

- PRNGs like this are **predictable** — anyone who knows the seed can reproduce all the “random” values.
- That's fine for games, simulations, or procedural generation.
- For cryptographic randomness (e.g., generating secure tokens), we use **CSPRNGs** (Cryptographically Secure PRNGs), like `secrets` in Python.

---

Want to see how to do the same die roll using a hand-coded PRNG (like a Linear Congruential Generator)?

  

  

Let’s dive into **Section 2.2: Message Authentication and Hash Functions** with a deep, theoretical, yet accessible exploration of the concepts, focusing on the mathematics and principles behind message authentication codes (MACs) and hash functions. I’ll explain how they ensure authenticity and integrity, break down their mechanics, and illustrate with examples—standalone, no prior context needed. We’ll emphasize the math where it shines, like hash function properties and security metrics.

---

### 1. What is Message Authentication?

- **Core Idea**: Message authentication protects against _active attacks_ (e.g., data tampering) by verifying a message’s **authenticity** (it’s from the claimed sender) and **integrity** (it hasn’t been altered). Unlike encryption, which hides content (confidentiality), authentication ensures trust in the message itself.
- **Threats Addressed**:
    - **Alteration**: An attacker changes “Pay $100” to “Pay $1000.”
    - **Spoofing**: A fake sender tricks the receiver.
    - **Replay/Delay**: Old messages reused or delayed to mislead.
- **Analogy**: A wax seal on a letter—only the sender’s unique stamp makes it legit, and a broken seal shows tampering.

### Key Aspects

- **Integrity**: Contents unchanged.
- **Source**: From the real sender.
- **Timeliness/Sequence**: Fresh, in order (optional, via timestamps or numbers).

---

### 2. Authentication Using Symmetric Encryption: Why It Falls Short

- **Idea**: Use symmetric encryption (e.g., DES) to authenticate. If only sender and receiver share the key \( K \), a valid ciphertext \( C = E(K, M) \) implies the sender made it, and decryption \( M = D(K, C) \) checks integrity.
- **Extras**: Add an error-detection code (e.g., CRC), sequence number, or timestamp to catch alterations, reordering, or replays.
- **Problem**: Encryption alone isn’t enough:
    - **ECB Mode Flaw**: In Electronic Codebook mode, each block encrypts independently (\( C_i = E(K, P_i) \)). Swap \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \)—both decrypt fine, but the message’s meaning shifts (e.g., “YES NO” → “NO YES”).
    - **Math Insight**: No inter-block dependency—reordering preserves block validity, breaking semantic integrity.
- **Conclusion**: Encryption ensures confidentiality, not authentication—active attacks exploit this gap.

---

### 3. Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

- **Definition**: A MAC is a small, fixed-size tag appended to a message, generated using a secret key shared between sender and receiver. It’s a cryptographic checksum proving authenticity and integrity.
- **Math Form**: \( MAC = F(K, M) \), where:
    - \( M \): Message (variable length).
    - \( K \): Secret key.
    - \( F \): MAC function (e.g., DES-based).
    - \( MAC \): Fixed-length output (e.g., 16–32 bits).
- **Process (Figure 2.3)**:
    1. Sender computes \( MAC = F(K, M) \), sends \( [M, MAC] \).
    2. Receiver recomputes \( MAC' = F(K, M) \), checks \( MAC' = MAC \).
- **Security**:
    - **Integrity**: Alter \( M \) to \( M' \), but without \( K \), attacker can’t compute \( F(K, M') \)—mismatch detected.
    - **Authenticity**: Only \( K \)-holders (sender) can generate a valid MAC.
    - **Sequence**: Add a number to \( M \) (e.g., \( M || seq \))—reordering fails.

### Example: DES-Based MAC (FIPS 113)

- **Method**: Use DES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):
    - \( C_i = E(K, P_i \oplus C_{i-1}) \), \( C_0 = IV \) (initial vector, often 0).
    - Last block \( C_n \) (or part of it, e.g., 32 bits) is the MAC.
- **Toy Example**:
    - \( M = "HI" \) (2 blocks: \( P_1 = H \), \( P_2 = I \)), \( K = 123 \).
    - \( C_1 = E(K, H \oplus 0) \), \( C_2 = E(K, I \oplus C_1) \).
    - \( MAC = C_2[0:32] \) (first 32 bits of last block).
    - Alter \( M' = "HO" \), recompute—\( C_2' \neq C_2 \), mismatch.
- **Why Not Reversible?**: \( F \) doesn’t need decryption—only matching matters, reducing attack surface vs. encryption.

### Math Property

- **Collision**: Many \( M \) map to one MAC (infinite inputs, finite outputs). But finding \( M' \neq M \) with \( F(K, M') = F(K, M) \) is hard without \( K \) (collision resistance).

---

### 4. One-Way Hash Functions

- **Definition**: A hash function \( H(M) \) takes a variable-length message \( M \) and produces a fixed-length **message digest** \( h \) (e.g., 160 bits for SHA-1), without a key.
- **Process (Figure 2.4)**:
    - Pad \( M \) to a multiple of a block size (e.g., 512 bits), append length (e.g., 64-bit \( L \)).
    - \( h = H(M || padding || L) \).
- **Use Cases**: Authentication (with encryption or keys), signatures, integrity checks.

### Hash Function Requirements

1. **Any Size Input**: \( H \) handles \( M \) of any length.
2. **Fixed Output**: \( h \) is always \( n \) bits (e.g., 256 for SHA-256).
3. **Efficient**: \( H(M) \) computes fast in hardware/software.
4. **Preimage Resistance**: Given \( h \), finding \( x \) where \( H(x) = h \) is infeasible (\( 2^n \) effort).
5. **Second Preimage Resistance**: Given \( x \), finding \( y \neq x \) with \( H(y) = H(x) \) is infeasible (\( 2^n \) effort).
6. **Collision Resistance**: Finding any \( (x, y) \) where \( x \neq y \) and \( H(x) = H(y) \) is infeasible (\( 2^{n/2} \) effort).

- **Math Insight**:
    - **Preimage**: \( H \) is a many-to-one map—\( h \) has infinite preimages, but reversing \( h \to x \) is a needle-in-haystack problem.
    - **Collision**: Birthday paradox—\( 2^{n/2} \) random tries find a pair with same \( h \) (e.g., \( 2^{80} \) for 160 bits), far less than \( 2^n \).

### Authentication with Hash (Figure 2.5)

- **Symmetric Encryption (a)**: \( E(K, H(M)) \) sent with \( M \). Receiver decrypts, recomputes \( H(M) \)—matches if authentic.
- **Public-Key (b)**: Sender encrypts \( H(M) \) with private key (signature). Public key decrypts—verifies sender.
- **Keyed Hash MAC (c)**: \( H(K || M || K) \) (secret \( K \) concatenated). No encryption, fast, secure if \( K \) hidden.

### Keyed Hash MAC Example

- \( M = "PAY 100" \), \( K = "SECRET" \).
- \( H(K || M || K) = H("SECRET || PAY 100 || SECRET") = h \) (e.g., 256-bit digest).
- Send \( [M, h] \). Receiver recomputes—matches if untampered.
- **Why \( K \) Twice?**: Prefix-only or suffix-only is weaker (Chapter 21)—dual use thwarts certain attacks (e.g., length extension).

---

### 5. Secure Hash Functions

- **Purpose**: Fingerprint data for authentication, signatures, integrity.
- **SHA Family**:
    - **SHA-1**: 160 bits, weakened (collisions found, \( 2^{63} \) effort vs. \( 2^{80} \)).
    - **SHA-2**: 256/384/512 bits, stronger (\( 2^{128} \) collision resistance for 256).
    - **SHA-3**: New design (Keccak), 2012, alternative to SHA-2.

### Security Math

- **Brute-Force**:
    - Preimage/Second Preimage: \( 2^n \) tries (e.g., \( 2^{160} \) for SHA-1).
    - Collision: \( 2^{n/2} \) tries (e.g., \( 2^{80} \) for SHA-1, \( 2^{128} \) for SHA-256).
- **Example**: SHA-1’s 160 bits → \( 2^{80} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{24} \) attempts for collision. Modern tech (e.g., $10M machine, 1994) cuts this—256+ bits now preferred.

### Cryptanalysis

- Exploit \( H \)’s structure (e.g., SHA-1’s weaknesses). Stronger than brute-force if successful—SHA-3’s redesign counters this.

---

### 6. Other Applications

- **Passwords**: Store \( H(password) \), not password. Login: Compute \( H(input) \), compare—preimage resistance hides originals.
- **File Integrity**: Store \( H(file) \). Later, recompute—mismatch flags changes (second preimage resistance).

---

### 7. Hands-On Example

- **MAC**: \( M = "SEND 10" \), \( K = 456 \), \( F = DES-CBC \), \( MAC = last 16 bits \). Alter to “SEND 100”—MAC fails.
- **Hash**: \( M = "HELLO" \), \( H = SHA-256 \), \( h = 256-bit digest \). Encrypt \( h \) with \( K \)—verifies sender.

---

### 8. Key Takeaways

- **MACs**: \( F(K, M) \)—keyed tags for authenticity/integrity.
- **Hash Functions**: \( H(M) \)—keyless digests, one-way, collision-resistant.
- **Math**: Security scales with output size (\( 2^n \), \( 2^{n/2} \))—stronger than encryption alone.

Let’s dive into **Section 2.3: Public-Key Encryption** with a deep, theoretical, yet accessible exploration, focusing on the mathematical foundations, mechanisms, and applications of public-key cryptography. I’ll break down how it differs from symmetric encryption, explain the key algorithms (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSS, ECC), and emphasize the math driving its revolutionary asymmetry—all standalone, no prior context needed.

---

### 1. What is Public-Key Encryption?

- **Core Concept**: Introduced by Diffie and Hellman in 1976, public-key encryption (or asymmetric cryptography) uses _two keys_: a **public key** (shared openly) and a **private key** (kept secret). Unlike symmetric encryption’s single shared key, this split enables new possibilities for confidentiality, authentication, and key distribution.
- **Breakthrough**: It’s not just bit-shuffling (like DES)—it’s built on hard mathematical problems (e.g., factoring, discrete logarithms), making it a paradigm shift after millennia of secret-key systems.
- **Analogy**: A mailbox—anyone can drop a letter in (public key encrypts), but only the owner’s key opens it (private key decrypts).

### Structure (Figure 2.6a)

- **Ingredients**:
    - **Plaintext (M)**: The readable message (e.g., "HELLO").
    - **Encryption Algorithm (E)**: Transforms \( M \) using a key.
    - **Public Key (PU)** / **Private Key (PR)**: Paired keys—one encrypts, the other decrypts.
    - **Ciphertext (C)**: Scrambled output (e.g., \( C = E(PU, M) \)).
    - **Decryption Algorithm (D)**: Reverses with the matching key (e.g., \( M = D(PR, C) \)).
- **Process**:
    1. User generates \( (PU, PR) \).
    2. \( PU \) is published; \( PR \) stays secret.
    3. Sender encrypts with \( PU \): \( C = E(PU, M) \).
    4. Receiver decrypts with \( PR \): \( M = D(PR, C) \).

### Modes

- **Confidentiality (Fig 2.6a)**: Encrypt with receiver’s public key—only their private key unlocks it.
- **Authentication (Fig 2.6b)**: Encrypt with sender’s private key—anyone with the public key verifies it’s from them.

### Misconceptions

- **Not Inherently Stronger**: Security depends on key size and algorithm difficulty, not symmetry vs. asymmetry.
- **Not Replacing Symmetric**: Public-key is slow (math-heavy)—symmetric handles bulk data better.
- **Key Distribution**: Still needs protocols (e.g., certificates)—not trivial.

---

### 2. Mathematical Foundations

Public-key cryptography hinges on **one-way functions with trapdoors**:

- **One-Way**: Easy to compute forward (encrypt), hard to reverse (decrypt) without extra info.
- **Trapdoor**: The private key is the secret that makes reversal easy.
- **Math Problems**:
    - **Factoring**: Hard to factor large numbers (RSA).
    - **Discrete Logarithm**: Hard to undo modular exponentiation (Diffie-Hellman, ECC).

### Requirements (Diffie-Hellman, 1976)

1. **Easy Key Generation**: Compute \( (PU, PR) \) efficiently.
2. **Easy Encryption**: \( C = E(PU, M) \) is fast with \( PU \).
3. **Easy Decryption**: \( M = D(PR, C) \) is fast with \( PR \).
4. **Hard Key Recovery**: \( PU \) reveals nothing about \( PR \) (e.g., \( 2^n \) effort).
5. **Hard Plaintext Recovery**: \( C \) and \( PU \) don’t leak \( M \) without \( PR \).
6. **Reversible Keys (Optional)**: \( D(PU, E(PR, M)) = M \) (e.g., RSA).

---

### 3. Asymmetric Algorithms

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, 1978)

- **Math Basis**: Factoring large composites.
- **Setup**:
    - Pick primes \( p, q \) (e.g., 61, 53).
    - \( n = p \cdot q = 3233 \), \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 3120 \).
    - Public exponent \( e = 17 \) (coprime to 3120).
    - Private exponent \( d \) where \( e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \) (e.g., \( d = 2753 \)).
    - \( PU = (e, n) = (17, 3233) \), \( PR = (d, n) = (2753, 3233) \).
- **Encrypt**: \( M \) (0 to \( n-1 \)), \( C = M^e \mod n \) (e.g., \( M = 65 \), \( C = 65^{17} \mod 3233 = 2790 \)).
- **Decrypt**: \( M = C^d \mod n \) (e.g., \( 2790^{2753} \mod 3233 = 65 \)).
- **Security**: Factoring \( n \) (e.g., 3233 → 61, 53) is hard—1024+ bits now standard.
- **Uses**: Encryption, signatures, key exchange (Table 2.3).

### Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (1976)

- **Math Basis**: Discrete logarithm in \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \).
- **Setup**:
    - Public: Prime \( p \), generator \( g \) (e.g., \( p = 23 \), \( g = 5 \)).
    - Alice: Private \( a = 6 \), Public \( A = g^a \mod p = 5^6 \mod 23 = 8 \).
    - Bob: Private \( b = 15 \), Public \( B = g^b \mod p = 5^{15} \mod 23 = 19 \).
- **Shared Secret**: Alice: \( B^a \mod p = 19^6 \mod 23 = 2 \). Bob: \( A^b \mod p = 8^{15} \mod 23 = 2 \).
- **Security**: Compute \( g^{ab} \) from \( g^a, g^b \) (discrete log)—infeasible for large \( p \).
- **Use**: Key exchange only (symmetric key sharing).

### Digital Signature Standard (DSS/DSA)

- **Math Basis**: Discrete logarithm, uses SHA-1.
- **Setup**: Prime \( p \), \( q \) (divisor of \( p-1 \)), \( g \), private \( x \), public \( y = g^x \mod p \).
- **Sign**: Message \( M \), random \( k \), \( r = (g^k \mod p) \mod q \), \( s = k^{-1} (H(M) + x \cdot r) \mod q \).
- **Verify**: \( u_1 = H(M) \cdot s^{-1} \mod q \), \( u_2 = r \cdot s^{-1} \mod q \), check \( (g^{u_1} y^{u_2} \mod p) \mod q = r \).
- **Use**: Signatures only—no encryption.

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- **Math Basis**: Discrete logarithm on elliptic curves (e.g., \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p \)).
- **Setup**: Curve parameters, base point \( G \), private \( d \), public \( Q = d \cdot G \).
- **Encrypt/Sign**: Similar to Diffie-Hellman/DSA, but over curve points.
- **Security**: Same strength as RSA with smaller keys (e.g., 256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA).
- **Use**: All three (Table 2.3), efficient for constrained devices.

---

### 4. Applications

- **Digital Signatures**: Sender encrypts \( H(M) \) with \( PR \) (e.g., RSA, DSA). Receiver decrypts with \( PU \)—verifies sender and integrity.
- **Symmetric Key Distribution**: Diffie-Hellman shares a secret, or RSA encrypts a symmetric key.
- **Encryption**: RSA/ECC encrypts messages or keys directly.

### Math Insight

- **Signatures**: \( H(M) \) (hash) ensures integrity; \( E(PR, H(M)) \) ties it to the sender.
- **Key Exchange**: \( g^{ab} \) (Diffie-Hellman) or \( E(PU, K) \) (RSA) leverages asymmetry.

---

### 5. Security Math

- **Strength**: Depends on key size and problem hardness:
    - RSA: \( 2^{n/2} \) to factor \( n \) (e.g., \( 2^{512} \) for 1024 bits).
    - Diffie-Hellman/ECC: \( 2^{n/2} \) for discrete log.
- **1994 RSA Challenge**: 428-bit key broken in 8 months—1024+ bits now secure.

---

### 6. Hands-On Example

- **RSA Toy**:
    - \( p = 3, q = 11, n = 33, \phi = 20 \).
    - \( e = 3, d = 7 \) (\( 3 \cdot 7 = 21 \equiv 1 \mod 20 \)).
    - \( M = 5 \), \( C = 5^3 \mod 33 = 125 \mod 33 = 26 \).
    - \( 26^7 \mod 33 = 5 \) (decrypts).
- **Diffie-Hellman**:
    - \( p = 7, g = 3 \), Alice \( a = 2, A = 3^2 \mod 7 = 2 \), Bob \( b = 4, B = 3^4 \mod 7 = 4 \).
    - Shared: \( 4^2 = 2^4 = 16 \mod 7 = 2 \).

---

### 7. Key Takeaways

- **Asymmetry**: \( PU \) encrypts, \( PR \) decrypts—math-driven revolution.
- **Algorithms**: RSA (all-purpose), Diffie-Hellman (key exchange), DSA (signatures), ECC (efficient).
- **Math**: Hard problems (factoring, logs) secure it—key size rules.

Let’s dive into how **public-key encryption** supports **authentication** and **confidentiality** modes, breaking down the mechanics, mathematics, and reasoning behind each. I’ll keep this theoretical yet approachable, focusing on the two modes illustrated in **Figure 2.6** from Section 2.3—confidentiality (using the receiver’s public key) and authentication (using the sender’s private key). We’ll explore how these work, their security foundations, and practical implications, all standalone with examples and analogies.

---

### 1. Public-Key Encryption Recap

- **Basics**: Public-key cryptography uses a pair of keys:
    - **Public Key (PU)**: Shared openly.
    - **Private Key (PR)**: Kept secret by its owner.
- **Math Property**: \( D(PR, E(PU, M)) = M \) (encrypt with one, decrypt with the other). Some systems (e.g., RSA) also allow \( D(PU, E(PR, M)) = M \).
- **Players**: Alice (sender), Bob (receiver), each with \( (PU_a, PR_a) \) and \( (PU_b, PR_b) \).

### Modes

- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only the intended recipient reads the message.
- **Authentication**: Proves the message came from the claimed sender (often with integrity).

---

### 2. Confidentiality Mode (Figure 2.6a)

- **Goal**: Keep the message secret from eavesdroppers—only the recipient can decrypt it.
- **How It Works**:
    1. Alice wants to send Bob a private message \( M \) (e.g., "MEET AT 5").
    2. Alice encrypts \( M \) with **Bob’s public key** \( PU_b \):
        - \( C = E(PU_b, M) \).
    3. Alice sends \( C \) over an insecure channel.
    4. Bob decrypts \( C \) with **his private key** \( PR_b \):
        - \( M = D(PR_b, C) = D(PR_b, E(PU_b, M)) \).
- **Outcome**: Only Bob, with \( PR_b \), can recover \( M \)—nobody else has the trapdoor.

### Mathematical Foundation

- **One-Way Function**: Encryption \( E(PU_b, M) \) is easy with \( PU_b \), but reversing \( C \to M \) without \( PR_b \) is computationally infeasible.
- **RSA Example**:
    - Bob’s keys: \( PU_b = (e=3, n=33) \), \( PR_b = (d=7, n=33) \) (\( p=3, q=11, \phi=20 \)).
    - \( M = 5 \), \( C = 5^3 \mod 33 = 125 \mod 33 = 26 \).
    - Bob: \( 26^7 \mod 33 = 8031810176 \mod 33 = 5 \) (recovers \( M \)).
- **Security**: Attacker with \( C = 26 \) and \( PU_b = (3, 33) \) must factor \( n = 33 \) or solve \( 26^{d} \mod 33 = 5 \) without \( d \)—hard (e.g., \( 2^{512} \) effort for 1024-bit \( n \)).

### Why It Works

- **Asymmetry**: \( PU_b \) is public—anyone can encrypt—but \( PR_b \) is Bob’s secret, locking decryption to him.
- **Analogy**: Bob publishes a padlock (open, \( PU_b \)). Alice locks her message box with it (\( C \)). Only Bob’s key (\( PR_b \)) unlocks it—eavesdroppers see a locked box.

### Practical Notes

- **Limits**: \( PU_b \) encrypts small data (e.g., RSA: \( M < n \)). For big messages, encrypt a symmetric key (e.g., AES key), then use that—hybrid encryption.
- **Threats**: If \( PR_b \) leaks, all messages are exposed. Algorithm strength (e.g., key size) matters too.

---

### 3. Authentication Mode (Figure 2.6b)

- **Goal**: Prove the message is from the sender (authenticity) and hasn’t been tampered with (integrity)—anyone can verify it.
- **How It Works**:
    1. Bob wants to send Alice a message \( M \) (e.g., "I’M BOB") proving it’s from him.
    2. Bob encrypts \( M \) with **his private key** \( PR_b \):
        - \( C = E(PR_b, M) \).
    3. Bob sends \( C \) openly.
    4. Alice decrypts \( C \) with **Bob’s public key** \( PU_b \):
        - \( M = D(PU_b, C) = D(PU_b, E(PR_b, M)) \).
- **Outcome**: If \( M \) makes sense (e.g., readable), only Bob, with \( PR_b \), could’ve created \( C \)—authenticity confirmed.

### Mathematical Foundation

- **Trapdoor**: \( E(PR_b, M) \) requires \( PR_b \), which only Bob has. Decrypting with \( PU_b \) (public) verifies this.
- **RSA Example**:
    - Bob’s keys: \( PU_b = (3, 33) \), \( PR_b = (7, 33) \).
    - \( M = 5 \), \( C = 5^7 \mod 33 = 78125 \mod 33 = 14 \).
    - Alice: \( 14^3 \mod 33 = 2744 \mod 33 = 5 \) (verifies \( M \)).
- **Security**: Forging \( C \) without \( PR_b \) means solving \( M^d \mod n = C \) for \( d \) (discrete log-like)—infeasible (e.g., \( 2^n \) effort).

### Why It Works

- **Asymmetry**: \( PR_b \) is Bob’s secret—only he can encrypt. \( PU_b \) is public—anyone can decrypt and trust it’s Bob.
- **Integrity Bonus**: Alter \( C \) to \( C' \)—decryption fails or yields gibberish (e.g., \( D(PU_b, C') \neq M \)).
- **Analogy**: Bob signs a letter with his unique signature (\( PR_b \)). Anyone with his public stamp (\( PU_b \)) checks it’s his—no forgery possible.

### Practical Notes

- **Not Confidential**: \( C \) is decryptable by all—anyone with \( PU_b \) sees \( M \).
- **Signatures**: Typically, encrypt a hash \( H(M) \) (e.g., SHA-256), not \( M \)—faster, ensures integrity. \( C = E(PR_b, H(M)) \), verify \( H(M) = D(PU_b, C) \).

---

### 4. Combining Both Modes

- **Scenario**: Alice sends Bob a secret, authentic message.
- **Steps**:
    1. Alice signs \( M \) with \( PR_a \): \( S = E(PR_a, H(M)) \) (signature).
    2. Alice encrypts \( M || S \) with \( PU_b \): \( C = E(PU_b, M || S) \).
    3. Bob decrypts with \( PR_b \): \( M || S = D(PR_b, C) \).
    4. Bob verifies with \( PU_a \): \( H(M) = D(PU_a, S) \).
- **Result**: Confidential (only Bob reads) and authentic (from Alice).

### Math Example

- \( M = 5 \), Alice \( PR_a = (7, 33) \), \( PU_a = (3, 33) \), Bob \( PU_b = (3, 55) \), \( PR_b = (27, 55) \) (\( p=5, q=11, \phi=40 \)).
- Sign: \( H(M) = 5 \), \( S = 5^7 \mod 33 = 14 \).
- Encrypt: \( M || S = 5 || 14 \), \( C = (5 || 14)^3 \mod 55 \) (simplified).
- Decrypt: Bob recovers \( 5 || 14 \).
- Verify: \( 14^3 \mod 33 = 5 \)—matches \( H(M) \).

---

### 5. Theoretical Insights

- **Confidentiality**:
    - **Security**: Relies on \( PR \) secrecy and algorithm strength (e.g., RSA factoring).
    - **Threat**: Known \( PU \) doesn’t help—\( C \) hides \( M \) unless \( PR \) leaks.
- **Authentication**:
    - **Security**: \( PR \) exclusivity—forging requires \( PR \) or breaking the math (e.g., discrete log).
    - **Integrity**: \( H(M) \) ties \( C \) to \( M \)—tampering breaks the match.
- **Math Contrast**:
    - Confidentiality: \( E(PU, M) \) → one-way without \( PR \).
    - Authentication: \( E(PR, M) \) → verifiable with \( PU \), but reversible.

### Effort

- **Attack**: \( 2^n \) (preimage) or \( 2^{n/2} \) (collision for signatures with hash)—e.g., 1024-bit RSA ≈ \( 2^{512} \).

---

### 6. Hands-On Examples

- **Confidentiality (RSA)**:
    - \( PU_b = (3, 15) \), \( PR_b = (7, 15) \) (\( p=3, q=5 \)).
    - \( M = 2 \), \( C = 2^3 \mod 15 = 8 \).
    - \( 8^7 \mod 15 = 2 \) (Bob only).
- **Authentication (RSA)**:
    - \( PR_b = (7, 15) \), \( PU_b = (3, 15) \).
    - \( M = 4 \), \( C = 4^7 \mod 15 = 4 \).
    - \( 4^3 \mod 15 = 4 \) (Alice verifies Bob).

---

### 7. Key Takeaways

- **Confidentiality Mode**: \( E(PU_b, M) \)—Bob’s public key locks, private key unlocks—secret to Bob.
- **Authentication Mode**: \( E(PR_b, M) \)—Bob’s private key signs, public key verifies—from Bob.
- **Math**: Asymmetry (PU vs. PR) powers both—one-way functions secure them.

This is a fantastic question that gets to the heart of how public-key cryptography’s asymmetry works! Let’s dive in with a deep, theoretical, yet clear explanation of why the private key decrypts messages encrypted with the public key (confidentiality mode) and why the public key decrypts messages encrypted with the private key (authentication mode). We’ll focus on the mathematics—particularly RSA, since it’s the most intuitive example of this reversible property—unpack the “why” behind it, and use examples to make it concrete.

---

### 1. The Core of Asymmetry: Mathematical Pairing

Public-key cryptography relies on a pair of keys—public (\( PU \)) and private (\( PR \))—that are mathematically related but distinct. The magic lies in a **trapdoor one-way function**: a process that’s easy to compute in one direction (encryption) but hard to reverse (decryption) without the trapdoor (the private key). For some algorithms like RSA, this function is _bidirectional_—either key can encrypt, and the other decrypts. Let’s explore why.

### Key Insight

- **Confidentiality**: Encrypt with \( PU \), decrypt with \( PR \).
- **Authentication**: Encrypt with \( PR \), decrypt with \( PU \).
- **Why It Works**: The keys are inverses of each other under the algorithm’s math—applying one undoes the other, but only the private key’s secrecy ensures security.

---

### 2. RSA: The Math Behind the Magic

RSA is the go-to example because its encryption and decryption are symmetric in structure—both use exponentiation modulo \( n \), but with different exponents (public \( e \) and private \( d \)). Let’s break it down.

### Key Generation

- Pick two primes: \( p \) and \( q \) (e.g., \( p = 3 \), \( q = 11 \)).
- Compute \( n = p \cdot q = 33 \).
- Compute \( \phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = 2 \cdot 10 = 20 \) (Euler’s totient).
- Choose public exponent \( e = 3 \) (coprime to 20).
- Find private exponent \( d \) where \( e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \):
    - \( 3 \cdot d = 1 \mod 20 \), so \( d = 7 \) (\( 3 \cdot 7 = 21 = 20 + 1 \)).
- Keys: \( PU = (e, n) = (3, 33) \), \( PR = (d, n) = (7, 33) \).

### Encryption and Decryption

- **General Form**:
    - Encrypt: \( C = M^e \mod n \) (with public key).
    - Decrypt: \( M = C^d \mod n \) (with private key).
    - OR: Encrypt: \( C = M^d \mod n \) (with private key).
    - Decrypt: \( M = C^e \mod n \) (with public key).
- **Why Reversible?**: \( e \) and \( d \) are modular inverses modulo \( \phi(n) \). Applying one exponent then the other returns the original message, thanks to number theory.

### Confidentiality Mode

- Alice encrypts to Bob with \( PU_b = (3, 33) \):
    - \( M = 5 \), \( C = 5^3 \mod 33 = 125 \mod 33 = 26 \).
- Bob decrypts with \( PR_b = (7, 33) \):
    - \( 26^7 \mod 33 = 8031810176 \mod 33 = 5 \) (back to \( M \)).
- **Math Reason**: \( C^d = (M^e)^d = M^{e \cdot d} \mod n \). Since \( e \cdot d = 21 = 20 + 1 = 1 \mod \phi(n) \), and \( M^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n \) (Fermat’s Little Theorem/Euler’s Theorem for coprime \( M \)), \( M^{e \cdot d} = M^1 = M \mod n \).

### Authentication Mode

- Bob encrypts with \( PR_b = (7, 33) \):
    - \( M = 5 \), \( C = 5^7 \mod 33 = 78125 \mod 33 = 14 \).
- Alice decrypts with \( PU_b = (3, 33) \):
    - \( 14^3 \mod 33 = 2744 \mod 33 = 5 \) (back to \( M \)).
- **Math Reason**: \( C^e = (M^d)^e = M^{d \cdot e} \mod n \). Same logic: \( d \cdot e = 7 \cdot 3 = 21 \equiv 1 \mod 20 \), so \( M^{d \cdot e} = M^1 = M \mod n \).

### Why This Happens

- **Modular Exponentiation**: \( M^e \mod n \) and \( M^d \mod n \) are permutations of numbers \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) (if \( e, d \) are inverses). Applying \( d \) to \( M^e \) or \( e \) to \( M^d \) cycles back to \( M \).
- **Trapdoor**: \( d \) is secret—computing it from \( e \) and \( n \) requires factoring \( n \) (hard, e.g., \( 2^{512} \) for 1024-bit \( n \)).
- **Bidirectional**: RSA’s symmetry (\( e \) and \( d \) swap roles) isn’t universal—other systems (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) don’t do this.

---

### 3. Why Private Decrypts Public-Encrypted (Confidentiality)

- **Mechanism**: \( C = E(PU, M) \) uses the public key, which anyone can access. But \( D(PR, C) = M \) requires the private key, known only to the owner (e.g., Bob).
- **Security**: The public key \( PU = (e, n) \) encrypts via \( M^e \mod n \)—easy to compute. Reversing \( C \to M \) without \( d \) means solving \( C^{1/e} \mod n \), a discrete logarithm problem tied to factoring \( n \)—infeasible without \( PR \).
- **Analogy**: \( PU \) is a public lock—anyone locks a box. \( PR \) is the secret key—only Bob unlocks it. The lock’s design (math) ensures only his key fits.

### Why Only PR Works

- \( e \) and \( d \) are inverses: \( e \cdot d = k \cdot \phi(n) + 1 \). Exponentiating by \( e \) then \( d \) (or vice versa) “unwraps” the message modulo \( n \), but \( d \)’s secrecy prevents outsiders from mimicking this.

---

### 4. Why Public Decrypts Private-Encrypted (Authentication)

- **Mechanism**: \( C = E(PR, M) \) uses the private key, which only the owner (e.g., Bob) has. \( D(PU, C) = M \) uses the public key, which everyone has—verifying Bob’s involvement.
- **Security**: Only Bob can produce \( C = M^d \mod n \) with \( PR = (d, n) \). Forging \( C \) without \( d \) is as hard as breaking RSA (factoring \( n \) or guessing \( d \)). Decrypting with \( PU = (e, n) \) confirms \( C \) came from \( PR \).
- **Analogy**: Bob signs a document with a secret seal (\( PR \)). Anyone with his public stamp (\( PU \)) checks the seal matches—no one else could forge it.

### Why PU Verifies

- \( d \) encrypts, \( e \) decrypts—same inverse property. If \( D(PU, C) = M \) is readable, it proves \( C \) was made with \( PR \), since \( e \) undoes \( d \)’s transformation.

---

### 5. The “Why” Behind the Reversal

- **Mathematical Symmetry**: In RSA, encryption and decryption are identical operations (exponentiation modulo \( n \))—only the exponent differs:
    - \( PU \) uses \( e \), \( PR \) uses \( d \).
    - \( e \cdot d \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n) \) ensures \( M^{e \cdot d} = M^{k \cdot \phi(n) + 1} = (M^{\phi(n)})^k \cdot M \equiv 1^k \cdot M = M \mod n \) (for \( M \) coprime to \( n \), extended via CRT otherwise).
- **Key Pairing**: \( e \) and \( d \) are designed as inverses—applying one then the other cancels out, regardless of order.
- **Not Universal**: RSA’s bidirectional property isn’t shared by all systems (e.g., Diffie-Hellman encrypts keys, not messages; ElGamal encrypts asymmetrically but signs differently).

### Confidentiality vs. Authentication

- **Direction**:
    - Confidentiality: \( PU \) (public) → \( PR \) (private)—hides \( M \).
    - Authentication: \( PR \) (private) → \( PU \) (public)—proves sender.
- **Access**:
    - Confidentiality: \( PR \) is secret—only the owner decrypts.
    - Authentication: \( PU \) is public—anyone verifies, but only the owner encrypts.

---

### 6. Hands-On Examples

### Confidentiality

- Bob’s \( PU_b = (3, 33) \), \( PR_b = (7, 33) \).
- Alice: \( M = 8 \), \( C = 8^3 \mod 33 = 512 \mod 33 = 17 \).
- Bob: \( 17^7 \mod 33 = 410338673 \mod 33 = 8 \).
- **Why**: \( 8^{3 \cdot 7} = 8^{21} = 8^{20} \cdot 8 \equiv 1 \cdot 8 = 8 \mod 33 \).

### Authentication

- Bob’s \( PR_b = (7, 33) \), \( PU_b = (3, 33) \).
- Bob: \( M = 8 \), \( C = 8^7 \mod 33 = 2097152 \mod 33 = 17 \).
- Alice: \( 17^3 \mod 33 = 4913 \mod 33 = 8 \).
- **Why**: \( 8^{7 \cdot 3} = 8^{21} \equiv 8 \mod 33 \) (same inverse).

### 7. Theoretical Nuances

- **Security**:
    - Confidentiality: \( PR \)’s secrecy ensures only Bob decrypts—attacker needs \( d \).
    - Authentication: \( PR \)’s exclusivity ensures only Bob encrypts—attacker can’t forge \( C \).
- **Integrity**: Authentication mode often uses \( H(M) \) (hash) to catch tampering—\( C = E(PR, H(M)) \).
- **Limits**: Not all systems (e.g., ECC) use this exact reversal—RSA’s exponent symmetry is unique.

### 8. Key Takeaways

- **Private Decrypts Public**: \( E(PU, M) \) locks with a public key; \( PR \) (secret inverse) unlocks—math ensures \( M^{e \cdot d} = M \).
- **Public Decrypts Private**: \( E(PR, M) \) signs with a secret key; \( PU \) (public inverse) verifies—same inverse property.
- **Why**: \( e \) and \( d \) are modular inverses—applying one undoes the other, but secrecy dictates direction (confidentiality hides, authentication proves).
