# Understanding Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

## Definition of API

- **API Overview:** An Application Programming Interface (API) facilitates communication between two pieces of software.
- **Communication Medium:** Allows interaction using inputs and outputs without requiring knowledge of the backend processes.
- **Interface Definition:** Refers to the visible part of the library, providing access to all program components.

## API in Library Example: Pandas

- **Pandas Library Example:** Demonstrates the use of the Pandas API for processing data.
- **Multilingual Backend:** Illustrates the existence of APIs for different languages, even if the backend component is the same.
- **TensorFlow Example:** TensorFlow, written in C++, utilizes APIs for various languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and Go.

## REST APIs Overview

- **REST APIs Definition:** Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs facilitate communication over the internet.
- **Utilizing Resources:** Enables leveraging resources like storage, data, and AI algorithms.
- **Client-Server Communication:** In a REST API, the program acts as the client, communicating with a web service through the internet.

## Common API Terms

- **Client:** Refers to you or your code, the entity making API requests.
- **Web Service:** Represents the resource accessed through the API.
- **Endpoint:** The location where the client finds the service.
- **HTTP Methods:** Data transmission over the internet occurs through HTTP methods.

## REST API Communication

- **Request and Response:** Clients send requests to the resource through HTTP methods and receive responses.
- **Data Transmission:** Data is transmitted using HTTP methods, and REST APIs utilize JSON files for communication.
- **Watson Text to Speech API Example:** Illustrates a POST request to convert speech to text and a GET request at the backend.
- **Watson Language Translator API Example:** Translates text (English to Spanish) through API communication.

## Key Takeaways

- **API Functionality:** Allows communication between software components.
- **REST API Advantages:** Facilitates internet-based communication, utilizing resources effectively.
- **Communication Protocols:** HTTP methods and JSON files play a crucial role in API interactions.

By understanding APIs and their variations, developers can enhance communication between different software components and leverage internet resources efficiently.

  

  

# Understanding Data Sets and Open Data

## Definition of Data Set

- **Structured Data Collection:** A data set is a structured collection of data, representing information in the form of text, numbers, or media like images, audio, or video files.
- **Tabular Data Format:** Tabular data sets often use formats like CSV, where rows represent observations at specific times, and columns store information about each observation.
- **Examples:** MNIST dataset for handwritten digits, weather station observations, and social network connections.

## Types of Data Ownership

- **Traditional Private Data:** Historically, data sets were private, containing proprietary or confidential information, not shared publicly due to commercial sensitivity.
- **Open Data Trend:** Over time, public and private entities started providing open data, making information freely available for public use and research.
- **Accessible Datasets:** Governments, scientific institutions, organizations, and companies publish datasets on various topics, contributing to data science and research.

## Open Data Sources

- **Global Open Data Portals:** Organizations like the United Nations, European Union, and governmental bodies worldwide maintain open data repositories covering diverse domains.
- **Online Platforms:** Kaggle offers a platform for data scientists to find and contribute to datasets, while Google's search engine helps discover valuable datasets on the internet.
- **Comprehensive List:** The Open Knowledge Foundation's [datacatalogs.org](http://datacatalogs.org/) website provides a comprehensive list of data portals globally.

## Community Data License Agreement (CDLA)

- **Open Data Licensing:** Open data distribution may have restrictions, prompting the creation of the Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) by the Linux Foundation.
- **CDLA-Sharing License:** Allows usage and modification of data, with the condition that modified versions must be published under the same license as the original data.
- **CDLA-Permissive License:** Grants permission to use and modify data without the obligation to share changes, providing flexibility in sharing derived results in data science.

## Impact on Data Science

- **Open Data's Role:** Open data has significantly contributed to the growth of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
- **CDLA's Contribution:** CDLA facilitates easier sharing of open data, ensuring compliance with specific licensing terms.
- **Enterprise Considerations:** While open datasets are valuable, enterprises may have concerns about their impact on business, leading to careful evaluation and usage.

By understanding the types of data ownership, accessing open data sources, and considering licensing agreements like CDLA, data scientists can effectively leverage datasets for research, development, and innovation.
