  

No matter how hard you try, you will miss important tests. no matter how careful and thorough a job you do, you will never find the last bug in a program, and if you do, you won’t know it.

  

> [!important] Testing is the process of searching for errors. Good test cases are more likely to find errors, or more likely to find serious errors, than poor test cases.

  

Karl Popper (1965) argues that the correct approach to testing a scientific theory is not to try to verify it, but to seek to refute the theory—that is, to prove that it has errors. The harsher the testing, the more confidence we can have in a theory that passes it.

  

> [!important] You can’t test a program completely.

- there would be a ton of possible paths throughout a program. you cannot find all of the combinations.

  

You will do your best work if you think of your task as proving that the program is no good. you are well advised to adopt a thoroughly destructive attitude toward the program. you should want it to fail. you should expect it to fail, and you should concentrate on finding test cases that show its failures. it is essential.

  

> [!important] The purpose of testing a program is to find problems in it.

  

A test that reveals a problem is a success. a test that did not reveal a problem was a waste of time.

  

> [!important] The purpose of finding problems is to get them fixed

- the prime benefit of testing is that it results in improved quality. bugs get fixed. you take a destructive attitude toward the program when you test, but in a larger context your work is constructive. you are beating up the program in the service of making it stronger.
