- Security engineering requires cross-disciplinary expertise from cryptography and computer security to economics and psychology.
- security engineers also need some skill at adversarial thinking, just like a chess player, you need to have studied lots of attacks that worked in the past.
- the conventional view is that software engineering is about ensuring that certain things happen, security is about ensuring that they don’t. but it is more complex and many systems fail because their designers protect the wrong things, or protect the right things but in the wrong way.
- you have to figure out what needs protecting, and how to do it.

  

# A framework

  

to build dependable systems, you need four things to come together:

1. Policy - what you’re supposed to achieve.
2. Mechanism - the ciphers, access controls, and other machinery that you use to implement the policy
3. Assurance - the amount of reliance you can place on each particular mechanism and their integration.
4. Incentive - the motive that the people guarding and maintaining the system have to do their job properly, and also the motive that the attackers have to try to defeat your policy.

  

Security engineers must be able to put risks and threats into context, make realistic assessments, of what might go wrong.

  

# Who are the opponents

  

one of the first things the security engineer needs to do when tackling a new problem is to identify the likely opponents.

  

# Psychology and Usability

Deception is now the principal mechanism used to defeat online security.
