A strong analysis depends on the integrity of the data

# Data Integrity

- the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle.
- data can lose integrity in many ways such as replication, manipulation, or when they are transferred.

  

### Data replication

- the process of storing data in multiple locations
- we might introduce inconsistencies and isolated islands of information

  

### Data transfer

- the process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another.
- data corruption and data importing

  

### Data manipulation

- the process of changing data to make it more organized and easier to read
- you might lose essential information in pursuit of cleanliness and organization

  

**Clean data + alignment to business objective = accurate conclusions**
