## Data-Driven Decision Making

- Data-driven decision-making involves **using factual information to guide business strategies and choices.**
- Data analysts play a crucial role in enabling organizations from various industries to make informed decisions using data.

**Steps in Data-Driven Decision-Making**:

1. **Identifying Business Needs**:
    - Typically, this involves identifying and defining a problem that needs to be solved or a goal to be achieved.
2. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
    - Data analysts gather relevant data and analyze it to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
    - The analysis can be used to build on past successful strategies or explore entirely new directions.

- While data is powerful, it becomes more effective when combined with human experience, observation, and intuition.
- **Subject matter experts**, familiar with the business problem, can provide valuable insights, validate choices, and complement data-driven strategies.
- Organizations that incorporate both data and human expertise in their decision-making processes benefit from a holistic approach.

  

**Data Analysts' Six-Step Process**:

1. **Ask Questions and Define the Problem**: Identifying the issue or challenge at hand.
2. **Prepare Data**: Collecting and storing relevant information.
3. **Process Data**: Cleaning and validating the data for accuracy.
4. **Analyze Data**: Identifying patterns, relationships, and trends.
5. **Share Data**: Communicating findings with the intended audience.
6. **Act on Data**: Using the analysis results to inform decisions and actions.

  

**Data + Business Knowledge + Gut Instinct**:

Gut instinct involves an intuitive understanding or feeling about a situation, often with minimal explanation.

- Data analysts often blend data, business knowledge, and a touch of **gut instinct** to navigate their projects effectively.
- The balance varies depending on project goals and constraints.
- Key questions to consider include defining project success, the required results, the target audience, the alignment with the question, and the urgency of decision-making.
- Time constraints may necessitate more reliance on personal knowledge and experience, while ample resources encourage a more data-driven approach.
- Data analysts learn to find the optimal blend through practice and experience.

  

  

**Analytical Skills for Data Analysts:**

1. **Curiosity**:
    - Curiosity is the desire to learn and seek new challenges.
2. **Understanding Context**:
    - Context is the setting or environment in which something occurs.
    - Recognizing context is vital for problem-solving; it's like putting pieces in the right order.
3. **Technical Mindset**:
    - A technical mindset involves breaking tasks into smaller, orderly, and logical steps.
    - You already use this when managing tasks like bill payments.
4. **Data Design**:
    - Data design is about organizing information logically, often relevant in databases.
    - Think of it as how you structure your contacts list in your phone for efficient access.
5. **Data Strategy**:
    
    - Data strategy involves managing people, processes, and tools for effective data analysis.
    - Analogous to preparing and mowing a lawn - ensuring the right tools, clear processes, and safe practices.
    
      
    

  

**5 Aspects of Analytical Thinking**

1. **Visualization**:
    - In data analytics, visualization means using graphical representations like graphs and maps to enhance understanding and communication of information.
    - Visuals simplify complex data, making it easier to convey insights and patterns.
2. **Strategy**:
    - With vast amounts of data available, a strategic mindset helps data analysts stay focused and determine their objectives.
    - Strategy ensures that data collection is purposeful and aligned with achieving specific goals.
3. **Problem-Orientation**:
    - Data analysts maintain a problem-oriented approach, keeping the primary issue in mind throughout the project.
    - Asking questions and seeking solutions centered around the core problem improve communication and save time.
4. **Correlation**:
    - Identifying correlations involves recognizing relationships between different pieces of data.
    - It's crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation; similar trends in data may not indicate a causal link.
5. **Big-Picture and Detail-Oriented Thinking**:
    
    - Big-picture thinking involves seeing the broader context and opportunities while not getting bogged down in details.
    - Detail-oriented thinking is about understanding and managing the specific components that contribute to a plan's execution.
    - Combining both perspectives is valuable in addressing complex business challenges effectively.
    
      
    

**Common Questions in Data Analysis**:

- **"What is the root cause of a problem?"** Root causes are identified using techniques like the Five Whys, which involves asking "why" multiple times to reveal the underlying issue.
- **"Where are the gaps in our process?"** Gap analysis assesses current processes compared to desired outcomes to identify and bridge gaps.
- **"What did we not consider before?"** This question prompts data analysts to identify missing information or procedures for better decision-making.

## Spreadsheets

Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you

- Collect, store, organize, and sort information
- Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
- Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.

## Databases and query languages

A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.

Query languages

- Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
- Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
- Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

## Visualization tools

Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.
