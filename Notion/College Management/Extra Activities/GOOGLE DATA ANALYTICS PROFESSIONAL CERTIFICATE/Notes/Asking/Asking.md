# Problem Types

1. Making prediction
2. Categorizing things
    1. assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features.
3. Spotting something unusual
    1. identifying data different from the normal
4. identifying themes
    1. grouping categorized information into broader concepts
5. discovering connections
    1. identifying similar challenges across different entities—and using data and insights to find common solutions.
6. Finding patterns
    
    1. using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is, therefore likely to happen again
    
      
    

# SMART Questions

  

S - SPECIFIC

M - MEASURABLE

A - ACTION-ORIENTED

R - RELEVANT

T - TIME-BOUND

  

Specific

- is the question specific
- does it address the problem
- does it have context
- will it uncover a lot of the information you need?

  

Measurable

- will the question give you answers that you can measure?

  

Action-oriented

- will the answers provide information that helps you devise some type of plan?

  

Relevant

- is the question about the particular problem you are trying to solve?

  

Time-bound

- are the answers relevant to the specific time being studied?

  

### Things to avoid when asking questions

- Leading questions
    - questions that only have a particular response
- Closed-ended questions
    - questions that ask for a one-word or brief response only
- Vague questions
    - questions that aren’t specific or don’t provide context

  

  

# Data-Driven Decision-Making

- means using facts to guide business strategy.
- Data is used to arrive at a decision.
    - This approach is limited by the quantity and quality of readily-available data.
- Potential dangers of relying entirely on data-driven decision making can include overreliance on historical data, a tendency to ignore qualitative insights, and potential biases in data collection and analysis.

# Data-Inspired Decision-Making

- Explores different data sources to find out what they have in common
- adds another layer of complexity

  

Data itself is useless. We need context to transform it into information. However, this is also not enough. We need to encode that information into knowledge.

  

  

# Quantitative and Qualitative

  

## Quantitative

- Specific and objective measures of objective facts
    - The what?
    - How many?
    - How often?

  

## Qualitative

- subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics
- can’t be measured with numbers
- focuses more on the Why

# Follow the Evidence

  

## Sharing your findings

- Data is useless if not communicated and shared properly
- Reports
    - static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically
    - Pros
        - High-level historical data
        - Easy to design
        - Pre-cleaned and sorted data
    - Cons
        - Continual maintenance
        - less visually appealing
        - static
- Dashboards
    - monitors live, incoming data
    - Pros
        - Dynamic, automatic, and interactive
        - more stakeholder access
        - low maintenance
    - Cons
        - labor-intensive design
        - can be confusing
        - potentially uncleaned data

  

## Data versus Metrics

  

### Metric

- single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement
- these usually involve a simple math formula
- these are usually the columns in a dataset
- Examples are ROI, customer retention rates, monthly sales

  

### Metric Goal

- a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

  

  

  

  

# Connect the data dots

  

## Mathematical Thinking

- mathematical thinking means breaking down a problem into smaller problems.

  

## Small Data

- describes a dataset made up of specific metrics over a short, well-defined time period
- usually organized and analyzed in spreadsheets
- likely to be used by small and midsize businesses
- simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent
- usually already a manageable size for analysis

  

## Big Data

- describes large, less-specific datasets that cover a long time period
- usually kept in a database and queried
- likely to be used by large organizations
- takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent
- usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making
- Three or four Vs for Big Data
    
    - Volume describes the amount of data. Variety describes the different kinds of data. Velocity describes how fast the data can be processed. Some data analysts also consider a fourth V: **veracity.** Veracity refers to the quality and reliability of the data. These are all important considerations related to processing huge, complex datasets. 
    
      
    

  

# Spreadsheets

- spreadsheets are popular with data analysts

  

## Spreadsheet Tasks

- Organize data
    - Pivot
        - Sort and filter
- Calculate data
    
    - Formulas
    - Functions
    
      
    

Operators are used in spreadsheets. These are the operators that we know in grade school.

Formulas are really just using operators in conjunction. It is just like the formulas in mathematics

  

## Errors and Fixes

  

### \#DIV/O!

- a formula is trying to divide a value in a cell by 0 or by an empty cell

  

### \#N/A

- data in a formula can’t be found by the spreadsheet
- usually occurs with VLOOKUP

  

### \#NAME?

- a formula or function name isn’t understood

  

  

### \#NUM!

- a formula or function calculation can’t be performed as specified

  

  

### \#VALUE!

- a general error that could indicate a problem with a formula or referenced cells

  

  

### \#REF!

- a formula is referencing a cell that is no longer valid or has been deleted

  

  

## FUNCTIONS

- is a preset command that automatically executes commands using the data

  

  

  

# Structured Thinking

- the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing the gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options

  

To efficiently solve a problem, we need to first know the problem. We need to define the problem domain.

Sometimes, data analysts start from scratch and do not have any context. They need to think structurally and critically to solve problems.

### Problem Domain

- the specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem
- we need to identify the base.

  

### Scope of Work or SOW

- an agreed upon outline of the work you’re going to perform on a project
- Deliverables
- Timelines
- Milestones
- Reports

  

## Context

- the condition in which something exists or happens

  

![[/Untitled 1 11.png|Untitled 1 11.png]]

  

It is up to the data analyst to take data into context and be objective.

  

A major limitation of data analysis is that if the data analysis is biased, the conclusions can be misleading.

- to combat this, make it a practice to ask questions using the W’s and H’s.
- The first and foremost that you can do to make objective conclusions is the population as representative as possible, your data gathering as objective and analytical

  

  

  

# Rememeber the Stakeholders

- it is important to meet the stakeholders’ expectations.
    - it is your responsibility as a data analyst to discover insights that will satisfy their needs.
- you need to know how to effectively communicate not only with the stakeholders but also with your team members

  

  

# Stay focused on the objective

  

1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
2. Who is managing the data?
3. Where can you go for help?

  

  

# Clear communication is the key

  

- **Think about your audience before communicating.** Consider who they are, what they already know, what they need to know, and how you can communicate that effectively.
- **Choose the right communication method for your audience.** A long email might not be the best way to communicate with your team about a problem, while a quick meeting might be more effective.
- **Be clear and concise in your communication.** Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your audience may not understand.
- **Be respectful and professional in your communication.** Even if you are frustrated or upset, it is important to communicate in a calm and professional manner.
