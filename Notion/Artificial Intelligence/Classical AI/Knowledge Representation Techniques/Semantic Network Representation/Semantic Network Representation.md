Alternative of predicate logic for knowledge representation

- Can represent our knowledge in the form of graphical networks
    - This network consists of nodes representing objects and arcs which describe the relationship between those objects
- Semantic networks can categorize the object in different forms and can also link those objects
- Semantic networks are easy to understand and can be easily extended.

  

# Semantic Network Components

  

### Nodes

- objects and concepts that appear graphically as circles, ellipses, or rectangles

### Links

- also called arcs, these express the relationship between nodes using arrows
- also called edges

### Labels

- further specify relations between concepts
- labels are placed on links and nodes
    - is a
        - shows that an object belongs to a larger category of objects
    - has a
        - shows the characteristics of an object node

### Bridge Node

- connects two different semantic networks
- For example, the word farm could be a bridge node that connects nodes for different semantic networks, such as animals and crops.

### Representation is mainly:

  

- IS-A (inheritance)
- Kind-of-relation (Associative)
    - two concepts are linked based on their frequency to occur together

### Benefits

- Simplicity
- Space efficiency
- Good organization
- Understandable meanings

  

### Challenges

- Lack of inheritance
    - it‚Äôs difficult for semantic networks to accurately pass characteristics from one data point to another
- Limited to object links
- Lack of meta-knowledge
- Challenges of expressing specific properties

  

Great ‚Äî let‚Äôs dive into an **in-depth, CS/AI-theory-style lecture on Semantic Network Representation**, a core idea in **knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR)**, especially relevant for building AI that "understands" structured relationships among concepts.

# üß† Lecture: Semantic Network Representation

### üéØ Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you'll understand:

- What a semantic network is and why it was developed
- Its components and structure (nodes, edges, inheritance, types of relationships)
- How it compares to other knowledge representations
- The theory and formal basis behind it
- How reasoning works using semantic networks
- Limitations and extensions (e.g. description logics, ontologies)

## 1. üìú Motivation: Why Semantic Networks?

In early AI, we needed ways to represent **knowledge about the world** in a form that both humans and machines could use. Propositional logic and FOL were good for deductive reasoning, but they lacked _intuitive structure_ for representing **conceptual relationships** like:

- "A canary is a bird"
- "Birds can fly"
- "Canaries can sing"

We needed:

- A way to **visualize and reason** about relationships
- A **hierarchical structure** for shared knowledge
- **Efficiency** via inheritance (no need to repeat facts)

Thus, **Semantic Networks** were developed in the 1960s and 70s.

## 2. üß© Core Structure of a Semantic Network

A **semantic network** is a **graph-based structure** used to represent knowledge in the form of **concepts (nodes)** and **relationships (edges)**.

### üß± Basic Elements

### **1. Nodes**

- Represent **concepts**, **objects**, or **instances**
- Examples: `Bird`, `Animal`, `Canary`, `Tweety`, `Fly`

### **2. Edges (Labeled Arcs)**

- Represent **relationships** or **properties**
- Common edge types:
    - `is-a` (class/instance)
    - `has-a` (attribute/property)
    - `part-of` (meronymy)
    - `can`, `lives-in`, `eats`, etc.

### üß† Example:

```Plain
Tweety ‚îÄ‚îÄ is-a ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Canary ‚îÄ‚îÄ is-a ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Bird ‚îÄ‚îÄ is-a ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Animal
  ‚îÇ                         ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ can ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Sing          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ can ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Fly
```

This structure allows _inheritance_ ‚Äî Tweety can fly, because it's a canary, which is a bird, and birds can fly.

---

## 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Theoretical Foundations

Although often viewed as informal, semantic networks have a **formal semantics** when interpreted in terms of **set theory** or **Description Logics (DLs)**.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Formal Interpretation

- **Concepts (nodes)** ‚Üí unary predicates: `Canary(x)`, `Bird(x)`
- **Relationships (edges)** ‚Üí binary predicates: `isa(x, y)`, `can(x, y)`
- Inference over the network can be interpreted using **First-Order Logic (FOL)**

### Example:

The statement:

```Plain
Canary ‚îÄ‚îÄ is-a ‚îÄ‚îÄ> Bird
```

translates to:

```Plain
‚àÄx (Canary(x) ‚Üí Bird(x))
```

This gives semantic networks their logical **entailment capability**.

---

## 4. üß¨ Inheritance and Default Reasoning

A key strength is **inheritance** ‚Äî the ability for subclasses or instances to **inherit properties** from more general classes.

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Inheritance Types:

- **Strict inheritance**: All subclasses must follow superclass rules
- **Default inheritance**: Subclasses can override superclass properties

### Example (default override):

- Birds can fly (default)
- Penguins are birds
- Penguins **cannot fly**

Semantic networks allow exceptions:

```Plain
Bird ‚îÄ can ‚îÄ> Fly
Penguin ‚îÄ is-a ‚îÄ> Bird
Penguin ‚îÄ cannot ‚îÄ> Fly
```

This enables **non-monotonic reasoning** ‚Äî a key capability in real-world AI.

---

## 5. üß† Reasoning with Semantic Networks

Inference in semantic networks includes:

### ‚úîÔ∏è Subsumption / Inheritance

- `Tweety is-a Canary` ‚Üí `Tweety is-a Bird`

### ‚úîÔ∏è Property Inheritance

- `Birds can fly` + `Tweety is a bird` ‚Üí `Tweety can fly`

### ‚úîÔ∏è Transitivity

- `Canary is-a Bird`, `Bird is-a Animal` ‚Üí `Canary is-a Animal`

### ‚úîÔ∏è Slot-filler inference

- `Car has-part Engine`, `Engine needs Fuel` ‚Üí `Car needs Fuel` (if rules exist)

This is analogous to **frame-based reasoning**, where entities have "slots" (attributes) with values.

---

## 6. üß∞ Applications

Semantic networks have inspired:

- **Ontologies**: Used in the Semantic Web (OWL, RDF)
- **Natural Language Understanding**
- **Expert Systems**: Rule-based AI with inheritance
- **Cognitive Science**: Modeling human concept memory
- **Search Engines and Knowledge Graphs** (e.g. Google Knowledge Graph)

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Variant|Description|
|**Typed Semantic Nets**|Adds types (classes) to relationships for formal checking|
|**Partitioned Nets**|Divides knowledge into contexts or "microtheories" (e.g., CYC)|
|**Description Logics**|Provides logic-based formalism for semantic networks (used in OWL)|
|**Frame-based systems**|Adds attributes and inheritance to concepts, like objects|
|**Conceptual Graphs**|Semantic networks with FOL-level semantics, introduced by John Sowa|

---

## 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Ambiguity** in informal graphs
- No built-in **temporal** or **modal** logic
- Poor at expressing **procedural knowledge** (how-to)
- **Scalability issues** in very large graphs
- Limited without formal semantics (but can be extended using DLs)
