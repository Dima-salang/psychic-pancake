Absolutely — let’s now dive deep into **Stage 2: Data Cleaning**, one of the **most critical and underestimated stages** in the entire machine learning pipeline. A well-cleaned dataset is often the **difference between a garbage model and a production-ready one**. This will be **extensive**, **thorough**, and **practical**, without sacrificing theoretical understanding.

# 🧼 Stage 2: Data Cleaning — _Making the Data Trustworthy_

## 🧠 What It Is:

Data cleaning (also known as data cleansing or scrubbing) is the **process of identifying, correcting, or removing inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and corruption** in the data.

> “90% of data science is cleaning the data. The other 10% is complaining about cleaning the data.” – Everyone

---

## ⚠️ Why It Matters:

- ML models **assume** the input data is clean and correct.
- Dirty data leads to **biased**, **unreliable**, or **uninterpretable** models.
- Skipping this stage can lead to **data leakage**, **overfitting**, or outright **failure** of the pipeline.

---

## 🧩 What Types of Problems Are Cleaned?

1. **Missing Values**
2. **Inconsistent or Invalid Formats**
3. **Outliers**
4. **Duplicated Records**
5. **Incorrect or Implausible Values**
6. **Data Leakage & Target Leakage**
7. **Typos & Categorical Noise**
8. **Structural Errors** (e.g., column mismatches)

Let’s go into each in depth.

---

## 1. 🕳️ Missing Values

### 🔍 Why They Happen:

- Sensor errors, human omission, merging tables
- Excel or DBs often encode missing values as `NULL`, `N/A`, `"missing"`, etc.

### 🛠️ Strategies:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Method|When to Use|
|**Remove rows**|If the missingness is rare and random|
|**Impute with mean/median/mode**|Numerical variables, if MAR (Missing at Random)|
|**Use forward/backward fill**|Time-series or sequential data|
|**Model-based imputation (KNN, MICE)**|High-stakes datasets|
|**Flag missingness with binary column**|When missingness might be informative|

```Python
df['income'].fillna(df['income'].median(), inplace=True)
df['has_income'] = df['income'].notnull().astype(int)
```

### 🧠 Best Practice:

> Never impute across the entire dataset — only fit imputers on the training set and apply to val/test to avoid data leakage.

---

## 2. 📆 Inconsistent or Invalid Formats

### Examples:

- Date formats: `"01-05-2023"` vs `"2023/01/05"`
- Currency: `"£1,000"` vs `"$1000.00"`
- Casing: `"NY"`, `"ny"`, `"New York"`

### 🛠️ Fixing Them:

- Use `pd.to_datetime()`, `pd.to_numeric()`
- Strip, standardize, lowercase strings
- Regular expressions for complex cleaning

```Python
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], errors='coerce')
df['state'] = df['state'].str.strip().str.lower()
```

### 📌 Rule:

> Normalize all representations before any kind of modeling or grouping.

---

## 3. 🚨 Outliers

Outliers can **distort models**, especially in regression or distance-based methods like KNN or clustering.

### Detection Methods:

- **IQR method** (Q3 + 1.5 IQR)
- **Z-score** or **Modified Z-score**
- **Box plots**, **scatter plots**
- **Isolation Forest**, **DBSCAN**

### Handling:

- Remove, Winsorize (clip), or treat as a separate category
- Only remove if **not domain-valid**

```Python
# IQR outlier removal
Q1 = df['age'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['age'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
df = df[~((df['age'] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df['age'] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR)))]
```

---

## 4. 🧍‍♀️ Duplicate Records

Duplicates may happen from:

- Joins/merges
- Batch insertions
- Manual entry

```Python
df = df.drop_duplicates()
```

> Rule: Remove full-row duplicates. For partial ones, deduplicate based on primary keys or domain logic.

---

## 5. ❌ Incorrect or Implausible Values

Examples:

- Age = 150
- Temperature = -300°C
- Sales = -5000

Fixing:

- Use domain knowledge to set thresholds
- Replace or drop values

```Python
df.loc[df['age'] > 120, 'age'] = np.nan
```

---

## 6. 🔓 Data Leakage

Occurs when **information from the future leaks into the training set**. This can happen when:

- You impute test data using training + test
- You include target-related features (e.g., "amount paid" for predicting "will default")

**Solution**: Always split data **before** applying any preprocessing or statistics.

---

## 7. ✍️ Typos & Categorical Noise

Examples:

- `"male"`, `"Male"`, `"M"`
- `"USA"`, `"U.S."`, `"America"`

Fix:

- Lowercase
- Use mappings
- Fuzzy matching (`fuzzywuzzy`, `textdistance`)

```Python
df['gender'] = df['gender'].str.lower().replace({'m': 'male', 'f': 'female'})
```

---

## 8. 🧱 Structural Errors

- Mismatched columns in concatenated files
- Shifted rows/headers
- Misaligned data

Always inspect with:

- `df.head()`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, `df.columns`

---

## 🧠 Best Practices in Cleaning

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Best Practice|Why|
|Keep raw data untouched|Always have the original reference|
|Document each cleaning step|For reproducibility and transparency|
|Visualize before and after|Helps catch silent bugs|
|Clean before EDA, not after|Or your analysis may be misleading|
|Validate assumptions|Always check missingness patterns, value distributions|
|Modularize cleaning|Use functions, scripts, or Jupyter cells per issue|

## 🧭 Rule-of-Thumbs & Maxims

- **"Assume nothing. Validate everything."**
- **"If you don't clean your data, your model will try to."**
- **"Bad data is worse than no data."**
- **"You can't model what you don't understand — and cleaning helps you understand."**

## 📋 Data Cleaning Mini-Checklist

✅ Inspect shape and types

✅ Handle missing values

✅ Unify formats (dates, currency, text)

✅ Remove duplicates

✅ Validate ranges and domains

✅ Handle outliers

✅ Fix structural and categorical inconsistencies

✅ Split data **before** cleaning if necessary

✅ Keep copies and track changes

✅ Create a cleaning report or notebook
