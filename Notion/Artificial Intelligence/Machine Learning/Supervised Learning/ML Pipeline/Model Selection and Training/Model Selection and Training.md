# 🤖 **Stage 4: Model Selection & Training**

This is the **heart of machine learning** — choosing a model that learns patterns from your training data and makes accurate predictions on unseen data.

We’ll cover:

1. 🤔 What model selection really means
2. 🏗️ Types of ML models (with examples)
3. ⚙️ Model training: what happens under the hood
4. ✅ Best practices and rules of thumb

---

## 🔍 1. What Is Model Selection?

Model selection is the process of **choosing the right algorithm** for your specific problem and data.

Every model makes different **assumptions** about the data and works well for different **structures**, **distributions**, and **amounts** of data.

Your job is to **match the model to the problem** — like choosing the right tool for a job.

## 🧠 2. Types of Models in Supervised Learning

Let’s divide models based on task:

### 📦 For **Classification**

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Trees / Random Forests**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

### 📈 For **Regression**

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge / Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Trees / Random Forests**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
- **Neural Networks**

Each has strengths and weaknesses.

### ✅ Model Type Cheatsheet:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Model|Best for|Watch out for|
|**Logistic Regression**|Simple binary classification|Needs linear separation|
|**KNN**|Intuitive, few assumptions|Slow on large data, needs scaling|
|**Decision Tree**|Easy to interpret|Overfits easily|
|**Random Forest**|Robust, high accuracy|Slower, less interpretable|
|**XGBoost**|State-of-the-art for tabular|More tuning required|
|**SVM**|High-dimensional data|Sensitive to scaling and tuning|
|**Neural Networks**|Complex, large-scale problems|Needs large data, more tuning|

---

## ⚙️ 3. What Happens During **Model Training**?

Let’s break it down theoretically and practically.

### 🧠 What Is Learning?

Learning = **finding a function** f(x)→yf(\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow y

That minimizes **error** between predictions and actual labels.

For example, in linear regression:

y^=wTx+b\hat{y} = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b

The algorithm **adjusts** w\mathbf{w} and bb to **minimize the cost function** (like MSE).

---

### 🧮 Loss Functions

Quantifies how wrong the model is.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Problem Type|Common Loss Functions|
|Regression|MSE, MAE, Huber|
|Classification|Log Loss (Binary Cross Entropy), Hinge Loss|

---

### 🔁 Optimization Algorithms

These algorithms **adjust the model's parameters** to minimize the loss.

- **Gradient Descent** – Most common (SGD, Adam)
- **Tree-based** methods – Use splits based on information gain or Gini impurity

---

### 🛠️ Fitting the Model (Code Example)

```Python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Training
predictions = model.predict(X_test)  # Prediction
```

Under the hood:

- It builds 100 trees
- Each tree learns from a different bootstrap sample
- Final prediction is the majority vote

---

## 🧠 4. Best Practices in Model Selection & Training

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Best Practice|Why It Matters|
|🔁 Use **cross-validation**|Reliable performance estimate (e.g., k-fold CV)|
|🚦 Start simple|Use a baseline model like Logistic Regression|
|🧪 Use a **holdout test set**|Never touch it during training!|
|📊 Compare multiple models|Use consistent metrics and data splits|
|⚖️ Tune hyperparameters|Models have “knobs” that control learning|
|🧽 Regularize|Helps avoid overfitting (e.g., L1/L2, pruning)|
|⏱️ Track training time and complexity|Some models don’t scale well with data size|
|📐 Scale your features|Essential for SVMs, KNN, Logistic Regression|

---

### 🧪 Cross-Validation Example (K-Fold)

```Python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

scores = cross_val_score(LogisticRegression(), X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Avg Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

This ensures you're evaluating on **unseen folds** each time.

---

### 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning

Use Grid Search or Randomized Search:

```Python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

params = {'n_estimators': [100, 200], 'max_depth': [5, 10]}
grid = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(), params, cv=3)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(grid.best_params_)
```

---

## ✅ Model Training Checklist

✔️ Understand your problem: classification or regression

✔️ Try simple models first (baseline)

✔️ Split your data: train, validation, test

✔️ Use cross-validation to avoid overfitting

✔️ Track and compare multiple models

✔️ Regularize if needed

✔️ Scale and preprocess consistently

✔️ Tune hyperparameters

✔️ Avoid data leakage
