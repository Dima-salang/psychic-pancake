# üßÆ **2. Logistic Regression**

(A fundamental algorithm for classification problems)

---

### üß† Fundamental Idea:

Logistic Regression is a **linear classifier** that predicts probabilities using the **logistic (sigmoid)** function to squash the output between 0 and 1. It is used for **binary classification** (and extended to multi-class).

Whereas linear regression tries to **predict a number**, logistic regression tries to **classify into categories** (e.g., spam vs not-spam).

---

### üßÆ Mathematical Foundation:

Given a feature vector x\mathbf{x}, we compute a linear combination:

$$z = \mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b$$

Then apply the **sigmoid activation** to map it to a probability:

$$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$

So the prediction $\hat{y} \in (0,1)$ represents the **probability** that the input belongs to class 1.

---

### üß® Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy

The cost function is:

$$\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}) = - \left[y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y})\right]$$

This loss function is convex, allowing **gradient descent** to optimize it effectively.

---

### üìå When to Use:

- **Binary classification** problems (e.g., churn, fraud detection)
- You need **probabilistic output**
- You want something fast, simple, and **interpretable**
- You have **linearly separable classes**

---

### üêç Python Example:

```Python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Generate binary classification data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4, n_informative=2, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train logistic regression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

### üîß Training & Interpretation:

- Each coefficient $w_i$ shows the **log-odds increase** in class probability for a unit increase in the corresponding feature.
- You can access the probabilities using `model.predict_proba(X)`

---

### üß† Why Logistic Regression Works:

The sigmoid function ensures predictions are always between 0 and 1 (valid probability). Because the log-likelihood function is convex, there‚Äôs **a single global optimum**, making training efficient and reliable.

---

### ü™ñ Best Practices:

- Always **scale your features** (e.g., `StandardScaler`) when features differ in magnitude.
- Use **regularization** (L1 or L2) to prevent overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data.
- If classes are imbalanced, use `class_weight='balanced'`.
